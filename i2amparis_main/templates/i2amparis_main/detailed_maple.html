                                The China-MAPLE model consists of an energy system optimisation
                                module which is based on the TIMES modelling framework. TIMES is a modelling
                                platform for local, national or multi-regional energy systems, which provides
                                a technology-rich basis for estimating how energy system operations will evolve over
                                a long-term, multiple-period time horizon (Loulou and Labriet, 2007). It follows a
                                techno-economic (bottom-up) approach to describe the energy sectors in many details
                                through a variety of specific technologies characterised with their technical and
                                economic parameters. TIMES offers thus a detailed representation of energy sectors,
                                which includes extraction, transformation, distribution, end uses, and trade of
                                various energy forms and materials. TIMES computes an equilibrium on energy markets
                                (partial equilibrium) and determines an optimal configuration of the energy systems
                                to satisfy service demands at a minimum cost over a long-term horizon, while
                                respecting GHG emission limits.

                                The MAPLE model simulates the investment and operation of major energy technologies
                                under constraints of emissions reductions of GHGs and pollutants in local regions
                                in China. The model can project and simulate future energy use trends in reference
                                scenarios and other comparative scenarios of varying degrees of mitigation action.
                                The calculation objective of the model is that the total cost of the energy system
                                must reach the minimum while exogenously given energy demand and any other major
                                constraints on the energy system (e.g. technology availability and growth rates)
                                are satisfied. The costs include investment costs, residual values of assets,
                                fixed and variable operating costs and maintenance costs, local energy extraction
                                costs, the costs of energy imports beyond China, gains from exports to regions
                                outside of China, major energy transmission and distribution costs, related taxes
                                and additional subsidies.

                                The MAPLE version 1.0 model has one region
                                (China), i.e. the analysis is based on the national level.
                                In version 2.0, for the residential sector, the geographic
                                granularity of the model includes 31 provinces (regions).
                                That is because the residential sector accounts for a large amount of particulate
                                matter (PM2.5) emissions, and MAPLE aims to analyse the co-benefits of emissions
                                reductions for air quality. For the most recent version, more regions have been
                                developed for other sectors, including the residential, electricity, and
                                industrial sectors and sub-sectors.

                                When explicitly referring to the electricity sector,
                                it is possible to include intra-annual time slices by
                                season and day-night, to represent the specific variation in electricity supply
                                (such as from time- and weather-dependent renewables like wind and solar
                                photovoltaics) and demand during different typical periods of the day and
                                year (e.g. winter versus summer, day versus night).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Time-slices are especially important whenever the mode and cost of
                                production of an energy carrier at different times of the year are
                                signiﬁcantly different (Loulou and Labriet, 2007). This is the case
                                for instance when the demand for an electricity ﬂuctuates across the
                                year and a variety of technologies may be chosen for its production at
                                given times of the year (such as wind power when wind resources are high,
                                and solar photovoltaics when there is a high availability of solar radiation).
                                In such cases, the matching of supply and demand requires that the activities
                                of the technologies producing and consuming the electricity be tracked—and
                                matched—in each time slice.

                                The other main emissions, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), are
                                expected to be added in the next version. For the local pollutant emissions,
                                in version 2.0, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and primary

                                urbanisation rate, and industry structure, are exogenous. The current socioeconomic
                                modelling assumption is consistent with the model of the World Bank (2012) and other
                                literature. The average annual growth rate of the GDP of China will drop to nearly
                                6.2% in 2020 and will further decrease to approximately 4% after 2030. The model
                                assumes a population growth scenario in which having a second child is publicly
                                allowed. Based on various sources (Zeng et al., 2013), the model assumes that the
                                total population of China will gradually increase from 1.36 billion in 2010 to
                                1.433 billion by 2020, peak by 2025-2030, and thereafter decrease to 1.385 billion
                                by 2050. The urbanisation rate of China reached 54.77% in 2014; the rate will reach
                                58.2% in 2020, 67.1% in 2030, and 75.2% in 2050. These assumptions can be varied in
                                light of updated socioeconomic projection information.

                            <p>
                                In the TIMES modelling framework, the economic, population and sectoral growths are
                                used to determine specific drivers for the growth in energy demands in reference
                                scenarios with no climate change mitigation policy. For example, the demand for
                                the number of billion kilometre-vehicles (BVkm) travelled by automobiles is based
                                on GDP per capita, whereas the growth in the demand for residential space heating
                                is driven by the number of households. Once the drivers for the different energy
                                demands represented by NATEM are determined and quantified, the construction of
                                the reference demand scenario requires computing a set of energy service demands
                                over the horizon. This is done by choosing elasticities of demands to their
                                respective drivers, in each region, using the following general formula:
                            </p>
                            <p align="center">
                                <i>
                                    Demand = Driver <sup>Elasticity</sup>
                                </i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, for example the number of billion vehicle
                                km travelled by automobiles (BVkm) grows by a factor that is
                                the growth in the GDP per capita in a region to the power of a pre-defined elasticity:
                            </p>
                            <p align="center">
                                <i>
                                    BVkm = (GDP/capita) <sup>Elasticity</sup>
                                </i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In most cases the elasticities (which vary over time) are less than 1 and decrease
                                over time. For example, an elasticity of 0.8 means that a 10% increase in the growth
                                of GDP per capita in a region would result in an 8% increase in billions of vehicle
                                kilometres driven. Over time this could reduce to a much smaller elasticity,
                                reflecting empirical evidence that demand for energy services such as automobile
                                transport ultimately saturates with rising incomes.

                                The TIMES modelling framework also has the capability of estimating the price-based
                                response of these energy service demands to the changing conditions of scenarios in
                                which mitigation occurs. For example, if the cost of energy increases as fossil
                                fuels are replaced by renewables, or because fossil-subsidies are reduced, then
                                the demand for energy services could decrease. To do this, TIMES uses another set
                                of inputs, namely the price elasticities of the demands for each energy service
                                considered. The model can then calculate the new demands for these policy cases.

                                Calibration concludes with the base year calibration, which mainly includes the
                                following aspects: (i) total energy consumption and category-based energy
                                consumption of various sectors and sub-sectors; (ii) total energy consumption
                                and category-based energy consumption of third-level sub-sectors; (iii) energy
                                consumption per unit of end-use demand of major divisions; (iv) CO2 emissions;
                                and (v) emissions of conventional pollutants.

                                Energy consumption of sub-sectors of the industrial sector is derived on the basis
                                of energy consumption statistics given in the year 2010 (2015 in the updated
                                version in progress) from the Energy Balance Sheet and the Industrial Statistics
                                Yearbook. The energy consumption of the third-level sub-sectors in the industrial
                                sector calculated in the model is summarised according to sub-sectors after
                                calibration on the base year and main statistical data.

                                China is on the critical stage of its energy transformation reform
                                and meeting its NDC target for 2030. As a technology-rich model, and
                                like other bottom-up models, mitigation/adaptation measures and
                                technologies can be reflected by constraints for commodities and processes.
                                Referring to the “five-year plan” series, detailed emission standard and
                                mitigation technologies are reported for each sector, especially for final
                                demand sectors.

                                Demand for end-use energy services is the basis of analysis of the bottom-up
                                energy model. Useful energy provided by end-use energy equipment satisfying
                                demand for end-use energy for the current year is a prerequisite for analysis
                                of energy system optimisation. The demand for end-use energy services pertaining
                                to the Chinese regional model is classified into four major sectors, namely the
                                industrial sector, the transportation sector, the building sector
                                (commercial/residential sector), and the agricultural sector and others,
                                according to segments.

                                the model, based on the requirements of the PARIS REINFORCE project. The main
                                assumptions and technological data will be revised and updated to be consistent
                                with the current updating government database and other modelling groups in the
                                project.

                                The differences between China-MAPLE and other bottom-up models for China is mainly
                                reflected in four aspects:
                                <li>China-MAPLE integrates local pollutant control and co-benefit modules into the
                                    energy system framework, and models local pollutant emission control measures
                                    and technologies in key areas.
                                </li>
                                <li>With regard to the local pollutant module, the link between local emissions and
                                    energy systems is based on technical rather than activity levels to reflect the
                                    mitigation effects of technological advances and structural adjustments. Regarding
                                    the benefit evaluation module, it describes the benefits of local pollutants
                                    obtained through emissions reduction.
                                </li>
                                <li>China-MAPLE introduces energy supply curves in the energy supply module.
                                    The supply of coal, oil and natural gas includes both domestic production and
                                    imports, avoiding deviations caused by fixed energy costs.
                                </li>
                                <li>MAPLE model is currently applied in the World Bank Group project on
                                    China’s energy modelling project, with consideration of linking the
                                    bottom-up model with a typical top-down computable general equilibrium approach.

                                TIMES is a dynamic least-cost optimisation model, and as such contains three
                                components: an objective function, variables, and constraints. The first
                                component (objective) corresponds to minimising the net total discounted cost
                                (e.g. 3-5% is typically used in deep decarbonisation studies) of the entire
                                energy system. A single optimisation, which searches for the maximal net
                                total surplus, simulates market equilibrium for each commodity (energy, material,
                                demand). Maximising the net total surplus (i.e. the sum of producers’ and consumers’
                                surpluses) is operationally done by minimising the net total cost of the energy
                                system. The second component (variables) corresponds mainly to future investments
                                and activities of technologies at each time period, amount of energy produced or
                                consumed by technologies, as well as energy imports and exports. An additional
                                output of the model is the implicit price (shadow price) of each energy form,
                                material and emission, as well as the reduced cost of each technology (reduction
                                required to make a technology competitive). The third component (constraints)
                                corresponds to various limits (e.g. amount of energy resources available)
                                and obligations (e.g. energy balances throughout the system, useful energy
                                demand satisfaction) to be respected.

                                The main model assumptions leading to optimal outputs include
                                future technological developments and the structure of energy markets.
                                On the one hand, technological progress is exogenously assumed, and
                                economic agents have a perfect foresight of this. On the other hand,
                                energy markets are assumed to be under perfect competition. Moreover,
                                TIMES considers only energy markets, and thus equilibrium is not assumed
                                for all markets in the economy. From that perspective, TIMES computes
                                only a partial equilibrium on energy markets.

                                China is a country with a large difference in energy production and consumption
                                technologies among provinces. As a bottom-up technology-rich model, a large number
                                of data and parameter collection processes are required. The main parameters include:
                                <li>Technical parameters: efficiency, availability factor, lifetime, stock for base
                                    year, etc.

                                <li>Emission parameters: emission coefficient for fuels and for specific technologies.
                                </li>
                                <li>Policy parameters: new technology for starting year, new investment for
                                    technologies,
                                    technology share constraints, emission constraints, carbon tax, etc.

                                Taking the technical parameters of the power sector as an example, power
                                generation technologies mainly include thermal, nuclear and renewable energy power
                                generation technologies. Coal power and natural-gas-based power generation
                                constitutes the main technology of thermal power generation in China. With
                                regard to technical parameters of three typical coal-fired units, power
                                production efficiency of the supercritical unit is approximately 41-42%,
                                coal consumption per unit of power generation being about 310 grams of coal
                                equivalent (gce)/kWh, and that of the ultra-supercritical unit is 45%-47%,
                                coal consumption per unit of power generation standing at about 280 gce/kWh.
                                The natural gas power generation technology in the base year is mainly natural
                                gas-based gas turbine technology and gas-steam combined cycle units. Natural gas
                                in China has the merits of higher efficiency, relatively environmental protection,
                                smaller floor area and shorter construction period compared with coal-fired power
                                generation. Because construction and operating costs of nuclear power plants are
                                relatively high (about three times that of thermal power plants), its power
                                generation cost is higher (about 0.42-0.54 Yuan/kWh on average). Furthermore,
                                power generation technologies involving wind power, solar energy, biomass, small
                                hydropower and other sorts of renewable energy also play an important role in China's
                                power production.
