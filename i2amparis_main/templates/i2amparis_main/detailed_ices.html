                                  ICES is a recursive-dynamic multi-regional Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model
                                  developed to assess impacts of climate change on the economic system and to study
                                  mitigation and adaptation policies. The model’s general equilibrium structure allows
                                  for the analysis of market flows within a single economy and international flows with
                                  the rest of the world. This implies going beyond the “simple” quantification of
                                  direct costs, to offer an economic evaluation of second and higher-order effects
                                  within specific scenarios of climate change, climate policies and/or different trade
                                  and public-policy reforms in the vein of conventional CGE theory. The model is linked
                                  to the Aggregated Sustainable Development goal Index (ASDI) module that generates
                                  scenario and policy specific projections up to 2030 (2050) of selected SDG indicators
                                  allowing to assess the systemic implication of implementing a policy on countries’
                                  sustainability.

                                  ICES is a computable model: all the model behavioural equations are connected to the
                                  GTAP 8 database (Narayanan, Badri, & McDougall, 2012), which collects national social
                                  accounting matrices from all over the world and provides a snapshot of all economic
                                  flows in the benchmark year (2007). All economic flows related to fuel-specific energy
                                  production and consumption derive from GTAP-Power database (Peters, 2016) and are
                                  merged to GTAP 8 database.

                                  In order to perform a sustainability analysis, the GTAP database has been integrated
                                  with international statistics in order to single out the following sectors: Research
                                  and Development (R&D), Education, and Health. For the R&D sector, the indicator “R&D
                                  expenditure as percentage of GDP” from the World Development Indicators - WDI (World
                                  Bank 2016) and the “share of R&D financed by Government, Firms, Foreign Investment
                                  and Other National” from the OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators (OECD 2016)
                                  are used for attributing R&D to the different economic agents. A similar approach has
                                  been used for Education and Health sectors. Data on overall expenditure on health and
                                  education have been obtained from the WDI database (World Bank 2016).

                                  The ICES database has been further extended following the model developments regarding
                                  the public actor (Delpiazzo, Parrado, & Standardi, 2017). In addition to government
                                  revenues and expenditures already included in GTAP 8 database, other monetary flows
                                  have been made explicit: international transactions among governments (foreign aid
                                  and grants) and transactions between the government and the private households (net
                                  social transfers, interest payment on public debt to residents), flows among
                                  governments and foreign private households (interest payment on public debt to
                                  non-residents), and public debt.

                                  The model’s economic database is complemented with satellite databases on energy
                                  volumes (McDougall & Aguiar, 2008), CO<sub>2</sub> and non‐CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
                                  (Rose & Lee, 2008;
                                  Lee, 2008), which include nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>),
                                  and three fluorinated
                                  gases (F‐gases). Both energy volumes and emissions have an endogenous dynamic in the
                                  models and evolve the former, according to energy sector production, and the latter,
                                  proportionally to energy combustion processes (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions) and sectoral
                                  and
                                  household use of agricultural and energy commodities. GHG emissions do not include
                                  emissions from LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry). The median trend of
                                  GHG emissions across IAM scenarios (IIASA database) is targeted given the pattern of
                                  energy prices and adjusting sector-specific efficiency in energy use.

                                  The model is largely driven by the set of possible futures envisioned by the climate
                                  change community and known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (O’Neill, et al.,
                                  2017). These are five possible futures with different mitigation/adaptation challenges
                                  and are characterised by different evolutions of main socioeconomic variables. SSPs
                                  can be linked to Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that envision the GHG
                                  emission evolution and forcing and temperature rise due to specific patterns of
                                  socioeconomic growth (Riahi, et al., 2017).

                                  SSPs provide future patterns for population, working age population and GDP at

                                  our simulation. The GDP trend is instead a target to be met through a mix of country
                                  and sector-specific productivities that are exogenously set (primary factor and total
                                  factor productivity).

                                  In our reference scenarios, the growth of GDP, population and employment reproduces
                                  historical trends up to 2014 (WDI 2016) and then mimics SSP growth rates
                                  (OECD projections). Population trend relies on the WDI database (World Bank 2018) up
                                  to 2014 and then follows SSP growth rates (IIASA-WiC projections). Employment trends
                                  rely on the WDI database (World Bank 2018) up to 2010, then consider IIASA-WiC
                                  projections of working age population and other specific assumption of SSP storylines:

                                  The ICES model includes a climate policy module that allows designing mitigation
                                  policies through explicit or implicit carbon taxes internalising or correcting the
                                  external costs of polluting activities.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In the former case, carbon taxes are introduced into the model through specific ad
                                  valorem rates depending on the source of emissions. Carbon tax rates are calculated
                                  for each emitting source as the corresponding ratio between tax revenues and the
                                  total tax base. Then, this ad valorem tax is added to the supply price and determines
                                  the market price that households and firms finally face.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In the case of implicit carbon tax, regional emission limits can be imposed (quotas).
                                  Countries/regions can exchange emission rights starting from an initial allocation of
                                  permits in order to comply with the quota. The emission trade generates the optimal
                                  allocation of abatement and the emission price. In the ICES policy module, we can
                                  restrict emissions training to a set of countries, as in the case of EU-ETS, and
                                  combine it with direct carbon taxation in other countries, or allow for a global
                                  emissions trading system.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In the module, it is also possible to design mitigation scenarios curbing the carbon
                                  leakage effect (Border Tax Adjustments - BTA).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In each country/region revenues are collected by government that can use them to
                                  reduce public debt or increase government expenditure or rebate them to support
                                  household income (transfer), to subsidise specific firms or production factors
                                  (endowments or intermediates), and to support other countries (international transfer
                                  to specific countries or to an international fund, e.g. Green Climate Fund).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In addition to carbon taxation, ICES can implement other mitigation options such as
                                  subsidising clean energy production and its use (with direct effect on government
                                  deficit), imposing behavioural shifts on household and firm energy demand (without
                                  direct effect on government deficit), improving efficiency in energy use (with/without
                                  direct effect on government deficit), and applying the above described instruments and
                                  constraints to the agriculture, livestock and forestry sectors.

                              <p>
                                  The core structure of ICES derives from the GTAP-E model (Burniaux & Truong, 2002),
                                  which in turn is an extension of the standard GTAP model (Hertel, 1997). The General
                                  Equilibrium framework makes it possible to account for economic interactions of agents
                                  and markets within each country (production and consumption) and across countries
                                  (international trade). Within each country the economy is characterised by n
                                  industries, a representative household and the government. Industries are modelled as
                                  representative cost-minimising firms, taking input prices as given. In turn, output
                                  prices are given by average production costs. The production functions (Figure 20)
                                  are specified via a series of nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES)
                                  functions. Primary factors—including natural resources, land, labour, and a
                                  capital-energy composite—constitute the Value Added Energy (QVAEN) nest,
                                  which is combined with intermediates (QF), in order to generate the output.
                                  Perfect complementarity is assumed between value added and intermediates.
                                  This implies the adoption of a Leontief production function. For sector i in region r,
                                  final supply (output)<b>Y<sub>i,r</sub></b>, results from the following constrained
                                  production cost

                                  In the ICES production tree (Figure 20), the second nested level, on the left-hand
                                  side, represents the value added plus energy composite (QVAEN). This composite
                                  stems from a CES function that combines four primary factors: land (QLAND),
                                  natural resources (QNR), labour (QL) and the capital-energy bundle (QKE).
                                  Primary factor demand in turn derives from the first-order conditions of
                                  the following constrained cost minimisation problem for the representative firm:

                                 In turn, the capital-energy bundle combines capital with a set of different energy
                                  inputs. In fact, energy inputs are not part of the intermediates, but are associated
                                  to capital in a specific composite. The energy bundle is modelled as an aggregate of
                                  electric and non-electric energy carriers. Electricity sector differentiates between
                                  intermittent and non-intermittent sources. Wind and solar, which are intermittent
                                  sources, are separated from non-intermittent sources: hydro, nuclear, fossil and
                                  other non-fossil electricity. Economic flows detailing production and consumption of
                                  energy relies on the GTAP-Power database (Peters, 2016).

                                  The Non-Electric bundle is a composite of coal and energy from other fuels. The
                                  aggregate other fuels combine, in a series of subsequent nests, petroleum products
                                  with natural gas and crude oil. All elasticities regarding the inter-fuel substitution
                                  bundles are those from GTAP-E (Burniaux & Truong, 2002), while for the extended
                                  renewable electricity sectors we set those values considering different studies
                                  (Paltsev, et al., 2005; Bosetti, Carraro, Galeotti, Massetti, & Tavoni, 2006).

                                  The demand of production factors (as well as that of consumption goods), can be met
                                  by either domestic or foreign commodities, which however are not perfectly
                                  substitutable according to the "Armington" assumption. In general, inputs grouped
                                  together are more easily substitutable among themselves than with other elements
                                  outside the nest. For example, the substitutability across imported goods is higher
                                  than that between imported and domestic goods. Analogously, composite energy inputs
                                  are more substitutable with capital than with other factors.

                                  In the ICES model, as in GTAP, two industries are treated in a special way and are not
                                  related to any country, viz. international transport and international investment
                                  production. International transport is a world industry, which produces the
                                  transportation services associated with the movement of goods between origin and
                                  destination regions, thereby determining the cost margin between free-on-board
                                  (or f.o.b., before freight and insurance are added) and costs-insurance-freight
                                  (or c.i.f., inclusive of transportation margins) prices. Transport services are
                                  produced by means of factors submitted by all countries, in variable proportions.
                                  In a similar way, a hypothetical world bank collects savings from all regions and
                                  allocates investments in order to achieve equality in the absolute change of current
                                  rates of return.

                                  Figure 21 describes the main sources and uses of regional income. In each region, a
                                  representative utility maximising household receives income, originated by the
                                  service value of national primary factors (natural resources, land, labour, and
                                  capital), that they own and sell to the firms. Capital and labour are perfectly mobile
                                  domestically but immobile internationally (investment is instead internationally
                                  mobile). Land and natural resources, on the other hand, are industry-specific and
                                  sluggish<sup>1</sup>.Land is used only by the agriculture and livestock sectors, and
                                  competition for land is only among these two sectors; natural resources are of three
                                  types: forestry and fishing, fossil (coal, oil and gas), and other mining. Whether a
                                  sluggish endowment is used by more than one sector, its optimal allocation responds
                                  to the revenue maximisation of a household subject to a transformation frontier
                                  (Constant Elasticity of Transformation, or CET, formulation). Both land and natural
                                  resources are monetary aggregate variables in the base year, but price and quantity
                                  changes are distinguishable in simulation years.

                                  Government income equals to the total tax revenues from both private households and
                                  productive sectors, a series of international transactions among governments (foreign
                                  aid and grants), and national government-private transfers (Delpiazzo, Parrado, &
                                  Standardi, 2017). Both the government and the private household consume and save a
                                  fraction of their income according to a Cobb-Douglas function. The government income
                                  not spent is saved, and the sum of public and private savings determines the regional
                                  disposable saving, which enters the Global Bank as in the core ICES model.

                                  by each firm/sector. Public consumption is split into a series of alternative
                                  consumption commodities according to a Cobb-Douglas specification. However, almost all
                                  public expenditure is concentrated in the specific sector of non-market services,
                                  including education, defence and health. Private consumption is analogously addressed
                                  towards alternative goods and services, including energy commodities that can be
                                  produced domestically or imported. The functional specification used at this level is

                                  to account for possible differences in income elasticities for the various consumption

                                  The recursive-dynamic feature is described in Figure 22. Starting from the picture of
                                  the world economy in the benchmark year, by following socioeconomic (e.g. population,
                                  primary factors stocks and productivity) as well as policy-driven changes occurring in
                                  the economic system, agents adjust their decisions in terms of input mix (firms),
                                  consumption basket (households) and savings. The model finds a new general (worldwide
                                  and economy-wide) equilibrium in each period, while all periods are interconnected by
                                  the accumulation process of physical capital stock, net of its depreciation. Capital
                                  growth is standard along exogenous growth theory models and follows:

                                  strategies (the term of comparison in this case is generally a scenario with climate
                                  change impacts), e.g. understanding the benefits of changing the crop mix in the case
                                  of impacts in agriculture or of building preventive protections in the case of sea
                                  level rise causing land loss, or delving into behavioural shifts or efficiency changes
                                  associated to climate change (e.g. higher cooling demand), which are imposed
                                  exogenously before their economy-wide implications are assessed).

                                  The ASDI (Aggregated Sustainable Development goal Index) module aims at offering a
                                  comprehensive assessment of future sustainability up to 2030 (with the capacity to
                                  extend the analysis to 2050) based upon 27 indicators related to the 17 Sustainable
                                  Development Goals, under different socioeconomic and policy scenarios. ASDI module
                                  combines a modelling framework (ICES model) with an empirical one (regression approach
                                  based on historical data) to offer an internally-consistent set-up for analysing
                                  future patterns of sustainability indicators and their inter-linkages (Figure 23).

                                  Indicator selection is guided by the following requirements: relevance in measuring
                                  the SDG they refer to and connection with a specific quantitative SDG Target.
                                  Furthermore, ASDI indicators need to have good country coverage because the
                                  well-being assessment is worldwide and the comparability of the results of aggregation
                                  procedure requires excluding countries with missing values for at least one of ASDI
                                  indicators. ASDI indicators are at country level; the presence of a macro-economic
                                  model in our framework and the world coverage forces us to disregard more
                                  disaggregated indicators (gender, cohort, location-specific).  Furthermore, the most
                                  stringent constraint in selecting ASDI indicators comes from the sustainability
                                  assessment: drawing the future path of SDG indicators depends on identifying their
                                  determinants (empirical analysis on the historical data and evidence from the
                                  literature), and, at the same time, depicting the future evolution of these
                                  determinants using the ICES model. The lack of any empirical evidence connecting an
                                  SDG indicator with one or more endogenous variable in our model determined its
                                  exclusion from ICES set of indicators. Table 31 lists all ASDI indicators, except for
                                  those referring to climate action (SDG 13).

                                  Among ASDI indicators, sixteen are computed using model results, seven require
                                  regression analyses to be linked to them (SDG1, SDG2, SDG3a, SDG3b, SDG4, SDG7a,
                                  SDG10), and the remaining four are kept constant at historical levels (SDG14, SDG15a,
                                  SDG15c, SDG16). The collection of historical data of indicators relies on several
                                  international databases (World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2018), the UN
                                  database (United Nations, 2018), and World Income Inequality Database (WIID3.4)
                                  (United Nations, 2017b), and covers all available countries for the period 1990-2015.

                                  Historical data are used for initialising indicators in the base year of the model
                                  (2007) and for estimating the basic relationships between the model’s variables
                                  and indicators in the regression analysis phase. The ASDI module computes the values
                                  of the SDG indicators up to 2030 (2050) using the output of the ICES model.
                                  For the indicators not directly generated by the model, the estimated relationships
                                  from historical data with the regression analysis are used in an out-of-sample
                                  estimation procedure and combined with output variables of the model (main drivers are
                                  listed in Table 32). In order to derive SDG-specific indices (simple
                                  average of the underlying indicators) and the ASDI, ASDI indicator values are
                                  normalised, using a
                                  benchmarking procedure that identifies sustainable and unsustainable thresholds,
                                  and then aggregated.

                                              compared to the baseline scenario), especially in countries that have
                                              proposed relatively more stringent mitigation targets and suffer higher
                                              policy costs. Conversely, the impact of climate policy on inequality shows
                                              opposite sign but remains very limited. If financial support for

                                              international climate fund, the prevalence of poverty will be slightly
                                              reduced at the aggregate level, but the country-specific effect depends
                                              on the relative size of funds flowing to beneficiary countries and on
                                              their economic structure.
