                                  Calliope is an open-source energy modelling framework. It focuses on flexibility, high
                                  spatial and temporal resolution, the ability to execute many runs based on the same
                                  base model, and a clear separation of framework (code) and model (data). Its primary
                                  focus is on planning energy systems at scales ranging from urban districts to entire
                                  continents. In an optional operational mode it can also test a pre-defined system
                                  under different operational conditions.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Euro-Calliope is a freely available instance of the Calliope framework, which models
                                  the European electricity system at a high spatial resolution. It can be built on three
                                  spatial resolutions: on the continental level as a single location, on the national
                                  level with 34 locations, and on the regional level with 497 locations. On each node,
                                  renewable generation capacities (wind, solar, bioenergy) and balancing capacities
                                  (battery, hydrogen) can be built. In addition, hydro electricity and pumped hydro
                                  storage capacities can be built up to the extent to which they exist today. All
                                  capacities are used to satisfy electricity demand on all locations which is based on
                                  historic data. Locations are connected through transmission lines of unrestricted
                                  capacity. Using Calliope, the model is formulated as a linear optimisation problem
                                  with total monetary cost of all capacities as the minimisation objective. All elements
                                  of Euro-Calliope can be manipulated either by changing the configuration in
                                  config/default.yaml or by manipulating the build workflow before building the model.

                                  The broader Calliope framework has been used in many European projects and features in
                                  several peer-reviewed publications aimed at supporting energy policies at the national

                                  Euro-Calliope's key features are the ease of use, the flexibility to variable
                                  geographical and temporal resolutions, and the high degree of transparency and
                                  internal validation, in addition to a completely open-source and fully documented
                                  release.</p>

                                  <b>Easy-to-use, modular building blocks</b>
                              <p>
                                  Building a model is easy using Calliope's flexible text-based model definition format.
                                  Existing model instances, such as Euro-Calliope can be freely manipulated and adapted
                                  to the specific needs of the study of interest.
                                  This is a key point, because several of the features currently not implemented in the
                                  model (e.g. accounting for other emissions than CO2) might be included at need.

                                  full year). Moreover, such detail can be flexibily adapted, allowing to compromise at
                                  need between resolution and computational tractability.

                                  Unlike the majority of models, Calliope's code features a full set of internal tests
                                  and checks that ensure code's consistency across releases and code developments. This
                                  significantly increases the users' trust in the model and in its results, as well as
                                  the scientific robustness of the latter.

                                 Whilst not featuring direct integration with a climate module, Calliope allows for
                                  technology-specific accounting of direct and indirect emissions. As such, it is open
                                  to the implementation of any internationally-recognised emissions inventory. Moreover,
                                  the wide gallery of model instances for several different European countries, as well
                                  as for the whole EU-28, ensures already a full and up-to-date database of
                                  technology-specific emissions on which the user can rely.

                                  virtually included in the model at need, the basic implementation of Euro-Calliope
                                  features key mitigation technologies, such as Direct Air Capture (DAC) in combination
                                  with methanation of green hydrogn, for the production of carbon-neutral methane to be
                                  injected in existing gas grids. In addition, the model includes bioenergy power
                                  plants, which can be easily equipped with CCS technology (if need be), leading to
                                  BECCS.

                              <p>
                                  The model finds the energy system configuration which minimises total
                                  (investmet + operation) annualised costs. The optimisation is performed over a 1 year
                                  horizon, for 1-hour timesteps (i.e. 8760 total timesptes). Technologies lifetime is
                                  accounted for in the annualisation of their fixed costs. This assumes that the energy
                                  sector "actors" implicit in the model behave rationally and with perfect foresight of
                                  subsequent events. Such actors include: power plants owners, aggregators of
                                  residential distributed loads (heat pumps, electric vehicles), grid operators, etc.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  As an example, in each timestep the modell will have to satisfy the demand for any
                                  carrier (electricity, gas, hydrogen, etc.) at the minimum cost. However, this also
                                  needs to take into account the demand of the subsequent timesteps. For instance, the
                                  use of stored energy to meet demand might be the least-cost option in the timestep,
                                  but it may be preserved for subsequent timestep in which the model knows (thanks to
                                  its perfect foresight) that the same energy will be needed more.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  As anticipated, the implict actors in the model have perfect foresight of the future.
                                  However, it is possible to re-run any energy system configuration, obtained as the
                                  cost-optimal to meet a given demand scenario, in the so-called "operation" mode. In
                                  such mode, conceived to stres-test the operational feasibility of any configuration,
                                  the actors do not have full perfect foresight. Rather, the model operates based on a
                                  rolling horizon, in which actors have knowledge only of the subsequent 48 h (with the
                                  number of hours being a customisable parameter).

                              Key scenario assumptions for Euro-Calliope include energy technology characteristics
                                  (e.g. fixed and variable costs, efficiency, direct emissions); resource timeseries,
                                  such as wind, solar and hydroelectric timeseries; demand timeseries for each carrier;
                                  and capacity expansion maximum potential per technology (i.e. how many additional GW
                                  of a given technology can be installed at each location), if available.

                                  Key scenario results (outputs) from the Euro-Calliope model include the cost-optimal
                                  energy system configuration and the cost-optimal hourly dispatch of energy
                                  (or any other carrier) within the latter. It is worth noting that the resulting energy
                                  system configuration can be a green field result, if assuming that no existing
                                  capacity is kept in operation, or a brown field one, in which the capacity expands
                                  starting from the current one.

                                The outcomes of the model depend on the quality of the abovementioned parameters, and
                                  sensitivity analysis is always envisaged to complement the results.

                              <p>
                                  Several types of policies can be assessed by Euro-Calliope

                                  <b>Emissions-related policies</b>
                                  It is possible to impose a limit (carbon budget) on cumulative yearly emissions, as
                                  well as to modulate the budget across different energy sectors (e.g. 100%
                                  carbon-neutral power generation, 80% heat generation, etc.).
                                  It is also possible to include CO2 emissions in the objective formulation such that
                                  the minimisation of cost is weighted with the minimisation of CO2 emissions, both on
                                  a yearly and on a hourly basis. This is equivalent to assigning a price to CO2
                                  emissions.

                                  <b>Energy production policies</b>
                                  It is possible to define a large variety of energy policies, such as the imposure of a
                                  certain share of renewables or biofuels in either energy generation or installed
                                  capacity. As before, this can be modulated across differnt sectors and carriers with a
                                  high detail

                                  <b>Land use policies</b>
                                  It is possible to limit the total amount of land occupied in any one location, even at
                                  the subnational level, if land-use values are defined for each energy technology. Or,
                                  as for CO2 emissions, it is possible to give an additional price to such land
                                  occupation and make it feature in the objective function.

                                  penetration, use of bioenergy, etc., but also on SDGs related to climate (SDG13) and
                                  potentially to others (e.g. health) if additional emission metrics are included.

                                              Many favourable locations for high-temperature co-electrolysis (HTCOE) exist across Europe.
                                            HTCOE can become economically competitive for currently discussed CO2 prices.
