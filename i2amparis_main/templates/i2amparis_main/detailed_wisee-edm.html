                              <p>The industrial module of WISEE-EDM is used to analyse possible futures of an industrial
                                  production system and to derive technically consistent paths to them, starting from
                                  the current production system. </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                              Typical questions to the model are, for example:
                              <li>
                                  Which technology mixes make it possible to meet CO2 emission reduction targets in
                                  2050?
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  When do investments in innovative industrial processes have to start in order to
                                  achieve a set target status while maintaining the usual reinvestment cycles?
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Which energy sources are needed for a target-oriented path, in what quantities, when
                                  and where?
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  What will future production networks look like in technological and geographical
                                  terms?
                              </li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The model has a high level of technical detail and offers a variety of options for
                                  adapting the analysis to scenario-specific assumptions. It is therefore particularly
                                  suitable for developing scenarios in exchange with stakeholders.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                              The industrial module of WISEE-EDM is a "bottom-up" model of industrial production.
                              Bottom-up means that aggregated values such as CO2 emissions of the German steel industry
                              are derived from the properties and operation of the individual plants covered by the
                              model. Its databasis of industry plants currently (2020) covers the following industries:
                              <li>
                                  for EU-27+3: iron & steel, basic chemicals, refineries
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  for Germany in addition: pulp & paper, non-ferrous metals, cement, lime, glass
                                  (more on this see â€žKey featuresâ€œ).
                              </li>
                          </ul>
                              Developments of energy demand and CO2-emissions in other sectors are calculated using
                              econometric methods.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                              The industrial module of WISEE-EDM is strictly speaking a model family whose central
                              components are the following two modules:
                              <li>
                                  WISEE-EDM Dispatch (EDM-D): Calculates the use (dispatch) of production plants and the
                                  associated CO2 emissions, energy requirements, feedstock flows and the production of
                                  by-products (e.g. hydrogen from chlor-alkali electrolysis).
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  WISEE-EDM-Invest (EDM-I): Optimizes the Europe-wide investments in production
                                  facilities from an economic point of view over a given period of time, taking into
                                  account the demand for end products and transport costs between locations. (Currently
                                  parameterized for the chemical industry only)
                              </li>

                                             The Port of Rotterdam industrial cluster is heavily exposed to future
                                              decarbonisation policies, as most of its activities focus on trading,
                                              handling, converting and using fossil fuels. Using a mixture of
                                              qualitative and quantitative methods, the article explores three pathways
                                              whereby the portâ€™s industry can maintain its strong position while
                                              significantly reducing its CO2 emissions and related risks by 2050.
                                              Depending on mitigation target and choice of mitigation strategies,
                                              future technologies and infrastructure may differ greatly. Almost full
                                              decarbonisation of the cluster can be achieved by 2050, possibly even
                                              without CCS.

                                              The paper describes quantitative scenarios on a possible evolution of the
                                              EU petrochemical industry towards climate neutrality. The
                                              cost-optimization model used to develop the scenarios describes at which
                                              sites investments of industry in the production stock could take place in
                                              the future. Around 50 types of products, the related production processes
                                              and the respective sites have been collected in a database. The processes
                                              included cover the production chain from platform chemicals via
                                              intermediates to polymers. Pipelines allowing for efficient exchange of
                                              feedstock and platform chemicals between sites are taken into account as
                                              well. The model draws on this data to simulate capacity change at
                                              individual plants as well as plant utilization. Thus, a future European
                                              production network for petrochemicals with flows between the different
                                              sites and steps of the value chain can be sketched. The scenarios
                                              described in this paper reveal how an electrification strategy could be
                                              implemented by European industry over time with minimized societal costs.
