                              <p>The Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) is a global integrated
                                  assessment model that represents both human and Earth system dynamics.
                                  It explores the behaviour and interactions between the energy system,
                                  agriculture and land use, the economy and climate. The role of GCAM is
                                  to bring multiple human and physical Earth systems together in one
                                  place to provide scientific insights that would not be available from
                                  the exploration of individual scientific research lines. The model
                                  components provide a faithful representation of the best current
                                  scientific understanding of underlying behaviour.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  GCAM allows users to explore what-if scenarios, quantifying the
                                  implications of possible future conditions. These outputs are not
                                  predictions of the future; they are a way of analysing the potential
                                  impacts of different assumptions about future conditions. GCAM reads
                                  in external “scenario assumptions” about key drivers (e.g.,
                                  population, economic activity, technology, and policies) and then
                                  assesses the implications of these assumptions on key scientific or
                                  decision-relevant outcomes (e.g., commodity prices, energy use, land
                                  use, water use, emissions, and concentrations).
                              </p>

                                  It is used to explore and map the implications of uncertainty in key
                                  input assumptions and parameters into implied distributions of
                                  outputs, such as GHG emissions, energy use, energy prices, and trade
                                  patterns. Techniques include scenarios analysis, sensitivity analysis,
                                  and Monte Carlo simulations.

                                  GCAM has been used to produce scenarios for national and international
                                  assessments ranging from the very first IPCC scenarios (Response
                                  Strategies Working Group, 1990) through the present Shared
                                  Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (Calvin et al., 2017).

                              <p>GCAM takes in a set of assumptions and then processes those assumptions
                                  to create a full scenario of prices, energy and other transformations,
                                  and commodity and other flows across regions and into the future. The
                                  energy, agriculture and land use, economy and climate systems are
                                  interconnected and interact with each other (Figure 1). The
                                  interactions between these different systems are modelled as one
                                  integrated whole.

                              <p>Within each of the land regions shown in Figure 2, land is categorised into
                                  approximately a dozen types based on cover and use. In GCAM, competing uses of land
                                  are nested within land nodes. Within each land node, it is generally assumed to be
                                  easier to substitute products. Among arable land types, further divisions are made for
                                  lands historically in non-commercial uses (forests and grasslands) and commercial land
                                  uses (commercial forests and croplands). Production of approximately twenty crops is
                                  currently modelled, with specific yields depending on the land region and management
                                  type (with and without irrigation, high and low fertiliser).

                              <p>GCAM uses a global climate carbon-cycle climate module, Hector (Calvin et al., 2019),
                                  an open-source, object-oriented, reduced-form global climate carbon-cycle model that
                                  represents the most critical global-scale earth system processes. At every time step,
                                  emissions from GCAM (Table 11) are passed to Hector. Hector converts these emissions
                                  to concentrations and calculates the associated radiative forcing and the response of
                                  the climate system (e.g., temperature, carbon-fluxes, etc.).

                              <p>Hector has a three-part main carbon cycle: a one-pool atmosphere, three-pool land, and
                                  four-pool ocean (Figure 4). The atmosphere consists of one well-mixed box. The ocean
                                  consists of four boxes, with advection and water mass exchange simulating circulation.
                                  The high-latitude surface ocean takes up carbon from the atmosphere, while the
                                  low-latitude surface ocean off-gases carbon to the atmosphere. The land consists of a
                                  user-defined number of biomes or regions for vegetation, detritus and soil. The
                                  vegetation takes up carbon from the atmosphere while the detritus and soil release
                                  carbon back into the atmosphere. The earth pool is continually debited with each time
                                  step to act as a mass balance check on the carbon system. Hector actively solves the
                                  inorganic carbon system in the surface ocean, directly calculating air– sea fluxes of
                                  carbon and ocean pH. It reproduces the global historical trends of atmospheric [CO2],
                                  radiative forcing, and surface temperatures.</p>

                                  growth for each of the energy-economic regions. Each scenario requires assumptions
                                  about population and per capita GDP growth for future time periods, for example those
                                  of the SSPs. The macro-economic module takes both of these to produce overall GDP in

                              <p>Industrial sector growth
                                  Growth in industrial sectors is based on a pre-defined GDP elasticity which decreases
                                  over time, thus assuming saturation of industrial demand with rising incomes. The
                                  values of these elasticities vary per region and between different SSPs. Apart from a
                                  GDP elasticity, industrial demand also depends on an assumed price elasticity for
                                  industrial energy use.

                              <p>Per capita demand for passenger transport depends on an assumed GDP per capita
                                  elasticity and price elasticity, which means that more transport services are demanded
                                  at higher incomes and cheaper transport. However, there is also a time cost involved
                                  in transport, which increases proportionally with GDP per capita, and which is summed
                                  to the capital and energy costs of transport. This means that, at higher incomes,
                                  demand for passenger transport slowly saturates due to the price elasticity multiplied
                                  by the increasing costs of time. Also, demand shifts to faster ways of transport, for
                                  which time costs are lower. Demand for freight transport, like for industrial sectors,
                                  depends on an assumed GDP elasticity and price elasticity.

                              <p>The core operating principle for GCAM is that of market equilibrium. The representative
                                  agents in the modules use information on prices and make decisions about the
                                  allocation of resources. They represent, for example, regional electricity sectors,
                                  regional refining sectors, regional energy demand sectors, and land users who have to
                                  allocate land among competing crops within any given land region. Markets are the
                                  means by which these representative agents interact with one another. Agents indicate
                                  their intended supply and/or demand for goods and services in the markets. GCAM solves
                                  for a set of market prices so that supplies and demands are balanced in all these
                                  markets across the model (Figure 5); in other words, market equilibrium is assumed to
                                  take place in each one of these markets (partial equilibrium), and not in the entire
                                  economy across all markets (general equilibrium). The GCAM solution process is the
                                  process of iterating on market prices until this equilibrium is reached. Markets exist
                                  for physical flows such as electricity or agricultural commodities, but they also can
                                  exist for other types of goods and services, for example tradable carbon permits.
                              </p>
                              <p>As an example, in any single model period, GCAM derives a demand for natural gas
                                  starting with all of the uses to which natural gas might be put, such as passenger and
                                  freight transport, power generation, hydrogen production, heating, cooling and
                                  cooking, fertiliser production, and other industrial energy uses. Those demands depend
                                  on the external assumptions about, for example, electricity generating technology
                                  efficiencies, but also on the price of all of the commodities in the model. GCAM then
                                  calculates the amount of natural gas that suppliers would like to supply given their
                                  available technology for extracting resources and the market price. The model gathers
                                  this same information for all of the commodities and then adjusts prices so that in
                                  every market during that period supplies of everything from rice to solar power match
                                  demands.</p>

                              <p>GCAM is a dynamic recursive model, meaning that decision-makers do not know the future
                                  when making a decision today, as opposed to other optimisation models, which assume
                                  that agents know the future with certainty when they make decisions. After it solves
                                  each period, the model then uses the resulting state of the world, including the
                                  consequences of decisions made in that period—such as resource depletion, capital
                                  stock retirements and installations, and changes to the landscape—and then moves to
                                  the next time step and performs the same exercise. The GCAM version used is typically
                                  operated in five-year time steps with 2100 as the final calibration year. However, the
                                  model has flexibility to be operated at a different time horizon through user-defined
                                  parameters.</p>
                              <p>While the agents in the GCAM model are assumed to act towards maximising their own
                                  self-interest, the model as a whole is not performing an optimisation calculation. In
                                  fact, actors in GCAM can make decisions that “seemed like a good idea at the time”,
                                  but which are not optimal from a larger social perspective and which the decision
                                  maker would not have made had the decision maker known what lay ahead in the future.
                                  For example, the model’s actors do not know about future climate regulations, and
                                  could install fossil fuel power in the years preceding the implementation of such
                                  policies. Also, stated preferences by agents for certain technologies (e.g. transport
                                  modes) are calculated in the base year and such preferences are persistent into the
                                  future (their evolution can be changed by the user), preventing the solution to be
                                  completely cost-minimising or profit-maximising.</p>

                              <p>Outcomes in GCAM depend strongly on the assumptions made for socioeconomic,
                                  techno-economic, and agronomic parameters. While many of these parameters matter for
                                  the outcomes from the model, some can be identified as the most relevant ones, given

                              <p>One of GCAM’s uses is to explore the implications of different future policies. There
                                  are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:
                              </p>
                              <p>One of GCAM’s uses is to explore the implications of different future policies. There
                                  are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:
                              </p>
                              <p><b>Emissions-related policies:</b> There are three main policy approaches that can be
                                  applied in GCAM to reduce emissions of CO2 or other GHGs: carbon/GHG prices, emissions
                                  constraints, or climate constraints. In all cases, GCAM implements the policy approach
                                  by placing a price on emissions. This price then filters down through all systems in
                                  GCAM and alters production and demand. For example, a price on carbon would put a cost
                                  on emitting fossil fuels. This cost would then influence the cost of producing
                                  electricity from fossil-fired power plants that emit CO2, which would then influence
                                  their relative cost compared to other electricity generating technologies and increase
                                  the price of electricity. The increased price of electricity would then make its way
                                  to consumers that use electricity, decreasing its competitiveness relative to other
                                  fuels and leading to a decrease in electricity demand.</p>
                              <p>• Carbon or GHG prices: GCAM users can directly specify the price of carbon or GHG
                                  emissions. Given a carbon price, the resulting emissions will vary depending on other
                                  scenario drivers, such as population, GDP, resources, and technology.
                                  • Emissions constraints: GCAM users can specify the total amount of (CO2 or other GHG)
                                  emissions as well. GCAM will then calculate the price of carbon needed to reach the
                                  constraint in each period of the constraint.
                                  • Climate constraints: GCAM users can specify a climate variable (e.g. concentration
                                  or radiative forcing) target for a particular year. Users determine whether that
                                  target can be exceeded prior to the target year. GCAM will adjust carbon prices in
                                  order to find the least-cost path to reaching the target.
                              </p>
                              <p>Emissions prices of different GHGs can be linked together for a multi-gas policy.
                                  Additionally, markets in GCAM can be set for any emission species (e.g., CH4-only
                                  market, NOx market, etc.). In addition to identifying emission prices as one measure
                                  of cost, GCAM employs the “deadweight loss” approach to measuring welfare loss from
                                  emissions mitigation efforts through carbon pricing.</p>
                              <p><b>Energy production policies: </b>There are times when users would like to explore the
                                  implications of a constraint on production or a minimum production requirement. This
                                  capability allows GCAM users to model policies such as renewable portfolio standards
                                  and biofuels standards. Across sectors, these constraints must be applied as quantity
                                  constraints, but they can be applied as share constraints within individual sectors
                                  (e.g. fraction of electricity that comes from solar power). In implementing these
                                  policies, users can set either a lower bound or an upper bound. The model will solve
                                  for the tax (upper bound) or subsidy (lower bound) required to reach the given
                                  constraint.</p>
                              <p><b>Land use policies</b></p>
                              <p>• Protected Lands: With this policy, GCAM users can set aside a fraction of natural
                                  land, removing it from economic competition. This land cannot be converted to crops,
                                  pasture, or any other land type. This is similar to real-world policies such as
                                  reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).
                                  • Valuing carbon in land: When applying a price on carbon through any of the
                                  emissions-related policy approaches, GCAM users can choose whether that price extends
                                  to land use change CO2 emissions. This policy is modelled as a subsidy to land-owners
                                  for holding carbon stocks as opposed to a price on the emissions themselves.
                                  • Bioenergy constraints: GCAM users can impose constraints on bioenergy within GCAM.
                                  Under such a policy, GCAM will calculate the tax or subsidy required to ensure that
                                  the constraint is met.
                              </p>

                              <p>In GCAM-China, the 31 Chinese provinces are included as explicit regions that operate
                                  within the global GCAM model (Figure 3.4). Energy transformation (electricity
                                  generation and refined liquids production) and end-use demands (buildings,
                                  transportation, and industry) are modelled at the individual province level, and
                                  inter-province trade of all energy goods is considered. For electricity trade between
                                  provinces, provinces are grouped into 6 grid regions (Figure 3.4). Whereby provinces
                                  within the same sub-region can trade freely within that sub-region, trade between
                                  regions may be limited. Table 3.4 shows an overview of features calibrated at the
                                  country, grid and province level. The model can generate pathways through to 2100 with
                                  5 year time periods.
                              </p>
                              <p>The more detailed province-level approach for China has advantages over the global
                                  version of GCAM, in terms of more detailed assumptions on socioeconomic and energy
                                  futures, resulting into potentially more realistic reference scenarios. Also, the
                                  higher geographical granularity as advantages for policy analysis and impacts of
                                  climate policies might differ strongly between provinces.

                                  international trade in energy commodities. All the different elements of GCAM interact

                              <p>Within each of the land regions shown in Figure 2, land is categorised into
                                  approximately a dozen types based on cover and use. In GCAM, competing uses of land
                                  are nested within land nodes. Within each land node, it is generally assumed to be
                                  easier to substitute products. Among arable land types, further divisions are made for
                                  lands historically in non-commercial uses (forests and grasslands) and commercial land
                                  uses (commercial forests and croplands). Production of approximately twenty crops is
                                  currently modelled, with specific yields depending on the land region and management
                                  type (with and without irrigation, high and low fertiliser).

                              <p>GCAM uses a global climate carbon-cycle climate module, Hector (Calvin et al., 2019),
                                  an open-source, object-oriented, reduced-form global climate carbon-cycle model that
                                  represents the most critical global-scale earth system processes. At every time step,
                                  emissions from GCAM (Table 11) are passed to Hector. Hector converts these emissions
                                  to concentrations and calculates the associated radiative forcing and the response of
                                  the climate system (e.g., temperature, carbon-fluxes, etc.).

                              <p>Hector has a three-part main carbon cycle: a one-pool atmosphere, three-pool land, and
                                  four-pool ocean (Figure 4). The atmosphere consists of one well-mixed box. The ocean
                                  consists of four boxes, with advection and water mass exchange simulating circulation.
                                  The high-latitude surface ocean takes up carbon from the atmosphere, while the
                                  low-latitude surface ocean off-gases carbon to the atmosphere. The land consists of a
                                  user-defined number of biomes or regions for vegetation, detritus and soil. The
                                  vegetation takes up carbon from the atmosphere while the detritus and soil release
                                  carbon back into the atmosphere. The earth pool is continually debited with each time
                                  step to act as a mass balance check on the carbon system. Hector actively solves the
                                  inorganic carbon system in the surface ocean, directly calculating air– sea fluxes of
                                  carbon and ocean pH. It reproduces the global historical trends of atmospheric [CO2],
                                  radiative forcing, and surface temperatures.</p>

                                  about population and per capita GDP growth for future time periods, for example those
                                  of the SSPs. The macro-economic module takes both of these to produce overall GDP in

                              <p>Industrial sector growth
                                  Growth in industrial sectors is based on a pre-defined GDP elasticity which decreases
                                  over time, thus assuming saturation of industrial demand with rising incomes. The
                                  values of these elasticities vary per region and between different SSPs. Apart from a
                                  GDP elasticity, industrial demand also depends on an assumed price elasticity for
                                  industrial energy use.

                              <p>Per capita demand for passenger transport depends on an assumed GDP per capita
                                  elasticity and price elasticity, which means that more transport services are demanded
                                  at higher incomes and cheaper transport. However, there is also a time cost involved
                                  in transport, which increases proportionally with GDP per capita, and which is summed
                                  to the capital and energy costs of transport. This means that, at higher incomes,
                                  demand for passenger transport slowly saturates due to the price elasticity multiplied
                                  by the increasing costs of time. Also, demand shifts to faster ways of transport, for
                                  which time costs are lower. Demand for freight transport, like for industrial sectors,
                                  depends on an assumed GDP elasticity and price elasticity.

                              <p>The core operating principle for GCAM is that of market equilibrium. The representative
                                  agents in the modules use information on prices and make decisions about the
                                  allocation of resources. They represent, for example, regional electricity sectors,
                                  regional refining sectors, regional energy demand sectors, and land users who have to
                                  allocate land among competing crops within any given land region. Markets are the
                                  means by which these representative agents interact with one another. Agents indicate
                                  their intended supply and/or demand for goods and services in the markets. GCAM solves
                                  for a set of market prices so that supplies and demands are balanced in all these
                                  markets across the model (Figure 5); in other words, market equilibrium is assumed to
                                  take place in each one of these markets (partial equilibrium), and not in the entire
                                  economy across all markets (general equilibrium). The GCAM solution process is the
                                  process of iterating on market prices until this equilibrium is reached. Markets exist
                                  for physical flows such as electricity or agricultural commodities, but they also can
                                  exist for other types of goods and services, for example tradable carbon permits.
                              </p>
                              <p>As an example, in any single model period, GCAM derives a demand for natural gas
                                  starting with all of the uses to which natural gas might be put, such as passenger and
                                  freight transport, power generation, hydrogen production, heating, cooling and
                                  cooking, fertiliser production, and other industrial energy uses. Those demands depend
                                  on the external assumptions about, for example, electricity generating technology
                                  efficiencies, but also on the price of all of the commodities in the model. GCAM then
                                  calculates the amount of natural gas that suppliers would like to supply given their
                                  available technology for extracting resources and the market price. The model gathers
                                  this same information for all of the commodities and then adjusts prices so that in
                                  every market during that period supplies of everything from rice to solar power match
                                  demands.</p>

                              <p>GCAM is a dynamic recursive model, meaning that decision-makers do not know the future
                                  when making a decision today, as opposed to other optimisation models, which assume
                                  that agents know the future with certainty when they make decisions. After it solves
                                  each period, the model then uses the resulting state of the world, including the
                                  consequences of decisions made in that period—such as resource depletion, capital
                                  stock retirements and installations, and changes to the landscape—and then moves to
                                  the next time step and performs the same exercise. The GCAM version used is typically
                                  operated in five-year time steps with 2100 as the final calibration year. However, the
                                  model has flexibility to be operated at a different time horizon through user-defined
                                  parameters.</p>
                              <p>While the agents in the GCAM model are assumed to act towards maximising their own
                                  self-interest, the model as a whole is not performing an optimisation calculation. In
                                  fact, actors in GCAM can make decisions that “seemed like a good idea at the time”,
                                  but which are not optimal from a larger social perspective and which the decision
                                  maker would not have made had the decision maker known what lay ahead in the future.
                                  For example, the model’s actors do not know about future climate regulations, and
                                  could install fossil fuel power in the years preceding the implementation of such
                                  policies. Also, stated preferences by agents for certain technologies (e.g. transport
                                  modes) are calculated in the base year and such preferences are persistent into the
                                  future (their evolution can be changed by the user), preventing the solution to be
                                  completely cost-minimising or profit-maximising.</p>

                              <p>Outcomes in GCAM depend strongly on the assumptions made for socioeconomic,
                                  techno-economic, and agronomic parameters. While many of these parameters matter for
                                  the outcomes from the model, some can be identified as the most relevant ones, given

                              <p>One of GCAM’s uses is to explore the implications of different future policies. There
                                  are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:
                              </p>
                              <p>One of GCAM’s uses is to explore the implications of different future policies. There
                                  are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:
                              </p>
                              <p><b>Emissions-related policies:</b> There are three main policy approaches that can be
                                  applied in GCAM to reduce emissions of CO2 or other GHGs: carbon/GHG prices, emissions
                                  constraints, or climate constraints. In all cases, GCAM implements the policy approach
                                  by placing a price on emissions. This price then filters down through all systems in
                                  GCAM and alters production and demand. For example, a price on carbon would put a cost
                                  on emitting fossil fuels. This cost would then influence the cost of producing
                                  electricity from fossil-fired power plants that emit CO2, which would then influence
                                  their relative cost compared to other electricity generating technologies and increase
                                  the price of electricity. The increased price of electricity would then make its way
                                  to consumers that use electricity, decreasing its competitiveness relative to other
                                  fuels and leading to a decrease in electricity demand.</p>
                              <p>• Carbon or GHG prices: GCAM users can directly specify the price of carbon or GHG
                                  emissions. Given a carbon price, the resulting emissions will vary depending on other
                                  scenario drivers, such as population, GDP, resources, and technology.
                                  • Emissions constraints: GCAM users can specify the total amount of (CO2 or other GHG)
                                  emissions as well. GCAM will then calculate the price of carbon needed to reach the
                                  constraint in each period of the constraint.
                                  • Climate constraints: GCAM users can specify a climate variable (e.g. concentration
                                  or radiative forcing) target for a particular year. Users determine whether that
                                  target can be exceeded prior to the target year. GCAM will adjust carbon prices in
                                  order to find the least-cost path to reaching the target.
                              </p>
                              <p>Emissions prices of different GHGs can be linked together for a multi-gas policy.
                                  Additionally, markets in GCAM can be set for any emission species (e.g., CH4-only
                                  market, NOx market, etc.). In addition to identifying emission prices as one measure
                                  of cost, GCAM employs the “deadweight loss” approach to measuring welfare loss from
                                  emissions mitigation efforts through carbon pricing.</p>
                              <p><b>Energy production policies: </b>There are times when users would like to explore the
                                  implications of a constraint on production or a minimum production requirement. This
                                  capability allows GCAM users to model policies such as renewable portfolio standards
                                  and biofuels standards. Across sectors, these constraints must be applied as quantity
                                  constraints, but they can be applied as share constraints within individual sectors
                                  (e.g. fraction of electricity that comes from solar power). In implementing these
                                  policies, users can set either a lower bound or an upper bound. The model will solve
                                  for the tax (upper bound) or subsidy (lower bound) required to reach the given
                                  constraint.</p>
                              <p><b>Land use policies</b></p>
                              <p>• Protected Lands: With this policy, GCAM users can set aside a fraction of natural
                                  land, removing it from economic competition. This land cannot be converted to crops,
                                  pasture, or any other land type. This is similar to real-world policies such as
                                  reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).
                                  • Valuing carbon in land: When applying a price on carbon through any of the
                                  emissions-related policy approaches, GCAM users can choose whether that price extends
                                  to land use change CO2 emissions. This policy is modelled as a subsidy to land-owners
                                  for holding carbon stocks as opposed to a price on the emissions themselves.
                                  • Bioenergy constraints: GCAM users can impose constraints on bioenergy within GCAM.
                                  Under such a policy, GCAM will calculate the tax or subsidy required to ensure that
                                  the constraint is met.
                              </p>
