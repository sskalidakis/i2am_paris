                                  The MENA-EDS model provides detailed projections of energy demand, supply, power
                                  generation mix, energy-related carbon emissions, energy prices and investment to the
                                  future covering the global energy system. MENA-EDS is a fully fledged energy demand
                                  and supply simulation model aiming at addressing energy system analysis, energy price
                                  projections, power generation planning and climate change mitigation policies. It
                                  contains relations and/or exogenous variables for all the main quantities, which are
                                  of interest in the context of general energy systems analysis. These include
                                  demographic and economic activity indicators, primary and final energy consumption by
                                  main fuel, fuel resources and prices, CO2 emissions, greenhouse gases concentrations
                                  and technology dynamics (for power generation, road transport, hydrogen production
                                  and industrial and residential end-use technologies).
                              </p>

                                MENA-EDS quantifies CO2 emissions and incorporates environmentally oriented emission
                                  abatement technologies (like RES, electric vehicles, CCS, energy efficiency) and
                                  policy instruments. The latter include both market based instruments such as cap and
                                  trade systems with differential application per region and sector specific policies
                                  and measures focusing on specific carbon emitting activities. Key characteristics of
                                  the model, that are particularly pertinent for performing the analysis of the
                                  implications of alternative climate abatement scenarios, include world supply/demand
                                  resolution for determining the prices of internationally traded fuels and technology
                                  dynamics mechanisms for simulating spill-over effects for technological improvements
                                  (increased uptake of a new technology in one part of the world leads to improvements
                                  through learning by experience which eventually benefits the energy systems in other
                                  parts of the World).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                MENA-EDS is designed to provide medium and long term energy system projections and
                                  system restructuring up to 2050, both in the demand and the supply sides. The model
                                  produces analytical quantitative results in the form of detailed energy balances in
                                  the period 2015 to 2050 annually. The model can support impact assessment of specific
                                  energy and environment policies and measures, applied at regional and global level,
                                  including price signals, such as taxation, subsidies, technology and energy efficiency
                                  promoting policies, RES supporting policies, environmental policies and technology
                                  standards.

                          <p>
                            MENA-EDS  consists of a large set of equations describing the time evolution of key
                              variables, which are of interest in the context of a general analysis of the
                              energy-environment-economic system.Equations in the model represent the modelâ€™s endogenous
                              variables as a function of other endogenous variables, exogenous variables and parameters.
                              It is a recursive dynamic (partial equilibrium energy system) model with annual resolution
                              currently serviced to run up to the year 2050 (the process to extend model horizon to 2100
                              is ongoing). The MENA-EDS model has a triangular structure in order to avoid
                              contemporaneous simultaneity. On the other hand, simultaneity is modelled through lagged
                              instances of endogenous variables. Most of the model equations are specified in difference
                              terms in order to avoid excessive early variability and adequately represent accumulation
                              of uncertainty in the longer term.
                            The model is currently used to develop NDC and low-emission pathways for South Mediterannean
                              countries (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Luibya, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey,
                              Palestine), but can be expanded to other countries (this process is already implemented in
                              NDC ASPECTS project)
                          </p>

                              <p>
                                  The MENA-EDS model provides detailed projections of energy demand, supply, power
                                  generation mix, energy-related carbon emissions, energy prices and investment to the
                                  future covering the global energy system. MENA-EDS is a fully fledged energy demand
                                  and supply simulation model aiming at addressing energy system analysis, energy price
                                  projections, power generation planning and climate change mitigation policies. The
                                  model contains relations and/or exogenous variables for all the main quantities,
                                  which are of interest in the context of general energy systems analysis. These
                                  include demographic and economic activity indicators, primary and final energy
                                  consumption by main fuel, fuel resources and prices, CO2 emissions, greenhouse
                                  gases concentrations and technology dynamics (for power generation, road transport,
                                  hydrogen production and industrial and residential end-use technologies).
                              </p>

                                  MENA-EDS quantifies CO2 emissions and incorporates environmentally oriented emission
                                  abatement technologies (including renewable energy, electric vehicles, Carbon Capture
                                  and Storage, energy efficiency, electrification, green hydrogen, advanced biofuels)
                                  and energy and climate policy instruments. The latter include both market based
                                  instruments such as cap and trade systems with differential application per region
                                  and sector specific policies and measures focusing on specific carbon emitting
                                  activities. Key characteristics of the model, that are particularly pertinent for
                                  performing the analysis of the implications of alternative climate abatement
                                  scenarios, include world supply/demand resolution for determining the prices of
                                  internationally traded fuels and technology dynamics mechanisms for simulating
                                  spill-over effects for technological improvements (increased uptake of a new
                                  technology in one part of the world leads to improvements through learning by
                                  experience which eventually benefits the energy systems in other parts of the World).
                                  MENA-EDS is designed to provide medium and long term energy system projections and
                                  system restructuring up to 2050 (and 2100), both in the energy demand and the supply
                                  sides. The model produces analytical quantitative results in the form of detailed
                                  energy balances in the period 2015 to 2050 annually (to be expanded to 2100). The
                                  model can support impact assessment of specific energy and environment policies and
                                  measures, applied at regional and global level, including price signals, such as
                                  taxation, subsidies, technology and energy efficiency promoting policies, RES
                                  supporting policies, environmental policies and technology standards.

                                  The MENA-EDS model estimates in detail carbon dioxide emissions, as emerging from

                                  The model directly covers all emissions from the energy sector and the industry sector
                                  and can split CO2 emissions by sector (transport, industry, buildings, power
                                  generation, refineries, international bunkers, other) and by fuel (coal, oil,
                                  natural gas). The model is currently expanded to represent non-CO2 GHG emissions
                                  (including CH4, N2O and F-gases) through specific marginal abatement cost curves
                                  per region and sector.</p>
                              <p>Energy and climate policies affect these emissions: energy CO2 is derived from the
                                  changes in the energy sector induced by the policy, other emissions are affected by
                                  marginal abatement cost curves.</p>
                              <p>The model has been used extensively to study climate change mitigation scenarios, see

                               MENA-EDS is a technology-rich energy system model that represents most major fossil fuel
                                  and low-carbon technologies  that are envisaged to be available for at least the first
                                  half of the 21st century, and also including disruptive technological options,
                                  including zero and negative-emission technologies (incuding Biomass with CCS and
                                  Direct Air Capture) . By simulating the substitution of low or zero-carbon for
                                  high-carbon technologies in response to their relative costs, as well as emissions
                                  constraints and/or carbon prices, the MENA-EDS energy system model simulates

                              <p>
                                 MENA-EDS is a recursive dynamic energy system simulation model. Variables are either
                                  calculated directly or are calculated based on the previous years' values, to which
                                  are applied the evolution of explanatory variables and other exogenous parameters.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 The economic decisions regarding the investment and operation of the energy system are
                                  based on the current state of knowledge of parameters (costs and performance of
                                  technologies, prices, ...) or with a myopic anticipation of future costs and
                                  constraints. The model does not use foresight but myopic anticipation. Some foresight
                                  can be forced in the electricity production sector. The core operating principle of
                                  the model is that of market equilibrium. The representative agents in the modules use
                                  information on prices and make decisions about the allocation of resources. They
                                  represent, for example, regional electricity sectors, regional refining sectors,
                                  regional energy demand sectors. Markets are the means by which these representative
                                  agents interact with one another. The model solves for a set of market prices so that
                                  supplies and demands are balanced in all these markets across the model ; in other
                                  words, market equilibrium is assumed to take place in each one of these markets
                                  (partial equilibrium), and not in the entire economy across all markets (general
                                  equilibrium). The solution process is the process of iterating on market prices until
                                  this equilibrium is reached. The regional fuel markets are also integrated to form an
                                  international (global or regional) market equilibirum for crude oil, natural gas and
                                  coal.

                                                  This paper introduces a large-scale energy demand and supply model
                                                  that is used to quantify alternative energy system strategies for the

                                                  major hydrocarbon producers and a vast and currently untapped
                                                  potential for renewable power generation.

                                                  Uncontestably the south and east Mediterranean (SEM) region and the
                                                  European Union (EU) will mutually benefit by sharing energy resources
                                                  in view of their strategic long-term aspirations. The SEM region has
                                                  great potential for energy efficiency improvements and deployment of
                                                  renewables which are sufficient both to cover local needs and to

                                                  This analysis is based on a large-scale energy system modeling of both
                                                  the SEM and the EU regions and assesses two alternative cooperation
                                                  strategies. The first strategy is essentially based on centralized
                                                  actions involving large-scale exploitation of renewables in
                                                  large-scale installations with a mainly exportation orientation. This
                                                  strategy offers the best, cost-effective prospects for electricity
                                                  exports to the EU under mechanisms of remuneration based on power
                                                  purchase agreements (PPAs) and geographic expansion of the EU-ETS. The
                                                  second, alternative strategy gives priority to decentralized
                                                  investment aiming at exploiting dispersed renewable sources â€“ the
                                                  renewables recombined with proactive removal of current energy-pricing
                                                  distortions and policies providing incentives for energy savings by
                                                  energy consumers. The two scenarios differ in technology mix and have
                                                  different impacts on the energy system, the energy trade balance,
                                                  power generation costs, and investment financing. The scenarios also
                                                  require different regulatory and investment promoting frameworks to
                                                  materialize.
