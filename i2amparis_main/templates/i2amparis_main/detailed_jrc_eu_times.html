                                TIMES is a modelling platform for local, national or multi-regional energy systems,
                                which provides a technology-rich basis for estimating how energy system operations
                                will evolve over a long term, multiple period time horizon (Loulou and Labriet, 2008)
                                These energy system operations include the extraction of primary energy such as
                                fossil fuels, the conversion of this primary energy into useful forms (such as
                                electricity, hydrogen, solid heating fuels and liquid transport fuels), and the
                                use of these fuels in a range of energy service applications (vehicular transport,
                                building heating and cooling, and the powering of industrial manufacturing plants).
                                In multi-region versions of the model, the trade of fuels between regions is also
                                estimated. The TIMES framework is usually applied to the analysis of the entire
                                energy sector, but it may also be applied to the detailed study of single sectors
                                (e.g. the electricity and district heat sector).

                                The JRC-EU-TIMES (JET) model, is the multi-region, European version of TIMES,
                                which is designed for analysing the role of energy technologies and their
                                innovation needs for meeting European policy targets related to energy and
                                climate change. It models technologies uptake and deployment and their
                                interaction with the energy infrastructure in an energy systems perspective.
                                It is a relevant tool to support impact assessment studies in the energy policy
                                field that require quantitative modelling at an energy system level with a high
                                technology detail. The JRC-EU-TIMES model represents the EU Member States and
                                neighbouring countries, where each country is modelled as one region; producing
                                projections (or scenarios) of the EU energy system showing its evolution up to
                                2060 under different sets of specific technology and policy assumptions and
                                constraints.

                                The JRC-EU-TIMES model considers both the supply and demand sides and includes the
                                following seven sectors: primary energy supply (including transformation);
                                electricity generation; industry; residential; commercial; agriculture; and transport.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most relevant model outputs are the annual stock and activity of energy
                                supply and demand technologies for each region and period. This is accompanied
                                by associated energy and material flows including emissions to air and fuel
                                consumption, detailed for each energy carrier. Besides technical outputs, the
                                associated operation and maintenance costs, the investment costs for new
                                technologies, all energy and materials commodities prices
                                (including for emissions if an emission cap is considered),
                                are obtained for every time step.

                                The JRC-EU-TIMES includes in its base version 31 regions, connected by
                                energy/emissions trade, as follows: the EU-28 (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,
                                Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Finland,
                                France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Latvia,
                                Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia,
                                Slovakia and the United Kingdom) and Non-EU countries (Switzerland, Iceland, Norway).
                                The model can be optionally further expanded to the Balkans regions (Albania,
                                Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
                                Montenegro, and Serbia), although this configuration requires some modelling work.

                                According to its analytical paradigm, JRC-EU-TIMES models energy dynamics over a
                                multi period time horizon. The time horizon over which the model simulates the
                                evolution of the energy system is divided into a user-chosen number of time-periods;
                                which can vary depending on a number of factors, such as the scope of the analysis,
                                model setup, computational limitations, etc.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In its current version, the JRC-EU-TIMES model runs from 2010 (base year)
                                until 2060, with flexible number of intervals (from four to twelve).
                                For all quantities such as installed technology levels,
                                power plant capacities and energy and emissions flows,
                                any annual input quantity (e.g. coal used in a power plant per year) or
                                output quantity (e.g. electricity generated from the coal plant per year)
                                related to a given time period applies identically to each of the years in that
                                period.

                            <p>
                                In addition to the multi-year time periods described above, in the JET
                                there are time divisions within a year, called “time slices”, which may be
                                deﬁned by the user, so as to capture different weather conditions, consumer
                                behaviours, and energy demand conditions at different times of the year.
                                There are currently twelve time-slices representing an average of day, night
                                and peak demand for every one of the four seasons of the year (e.g. summer day,
                                summer night and summer peak, etc.).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Time-slices are especially important whenever the mode and cost of production of an
                                energy carrier at different times of the year are signiﬁcantly different
                                (Loulou and Labriet, 2008). This is the case for instance when the demand
                                for an electricity ﬂuctuates across the year and a variety of technologies may
                                be chosen for its production at given times of the year (such as wind power when
                                wind resources are high, and solar photovoltaics when there is a high availability
                                of solar radiation. In such cases, the matching of supply and demand requires that
                                the activities of the technologies producing and consuming the electricity be
                                tracked – and matched – in each time slice.

                                A special module of the JET can be enabled to allow emissions trading across

                                The JRC-EU-TIMES model requires inputs concerning the degree to which energy
                                demands, as well as demand for goods and services that result in GHG emissions,
                                will grow over the course of the next decades in the different countries.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Key drivers to the JRC-EU-TIMES model are the socioeconomic projections of GDP
                                growth; private consumption as a proxy for disposable income; price evolution
                                and sector production growth, population and number of households etc.; for each
                                country in the model. These drivers are transformed into the different final
                                annual end-use demand projections, which are the key quantities that the
                                JRC-EU-TIMES model must produce an energy system to satisfy.
                                The building-related sectors (namely residential and commercial sectors) require
                                a more detailed approach, as to generate the demands for heat, cooling and
                                hot water, characteristics of dwellings are explicitly represented
                                (Chiodi et al., 2017).

                            <p>
                                Across the years several sources and methodologies have been employed to
                                generate updated JRC-EU-TIMES energy services demands. For example in
                                Simoes et al. (2017), the materials and energy demand projections for each
                                country are differentiated by economic sector and end-use energy service,
                                using as a starting point historical 2005 data and macroeconomic projections
                                from the GEM-E3 model (Russ et al., 2009) as detailed in (Simoes et al., 2013),
                                and in line with the values considered in the EU Energy Roadmap 2050 reference
                                scenario (EC, 2011). These projections have been further updated to align with
                                latest socioeconomic projections in use within the European Commission
                                (Nijs et al., 2019; Nijs et al., 2017).

                                In total, the JRC-EU-TIMES represents about 60 different types of energy services
                                for the transport, residential, agricultural, commercial, industry and non-energy
                                sectors. Some examples include number of residential and commercial dwelling
                                stocks (thousands of dwellings), public street lighting
                                (thousands of lighting points), industry iron & steel (millions of tonnes),
                                transport car distance (billions of passenger kilometres) and transport road
                                freight (billions of tonne kilometres).

                                The socioeconomic, population and physical drivers
                                (e.g. physical production of industrial activities,
                                expected numbers of new dwellings) are used as
                                specific drivers for the growth in energy demands,
                                associated when relevant to demand elasticities,
                                see Loulou et al. (2016) for more details.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the drivers for the different energy demands represented
                                by JRC-EU-TIMES model are selected, allocated and quantified,
                                the construction of the reference demand scenario requires computing a set of
                                energy service demands over the horizon.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore JRC-EU-TIMES has the capability of
                                estimating the price-based response of these energy service demands to the
                                changing conditions of scenarios in which mitigation occurs. For example,
                                if the cost of energy increases as fossil fuels are replaced by renewables,
                                then the demand for energy services would decrease. To do this,
                                JRC-EU-TIMES makes use of another set of inputs, namely own price elasticities,
                                applied to each model energy service. This option can be easily disabled,
                                assuming in that case energy service demands to be inelastic.

                                JRC-EU-TIMES is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and
                                low-carbon technologies that are envisaged to be available (for those systems)
                                for at least the first half of the 21st century. By simulating the substitution
                                of low-carbon for high-carbon technologies in response to their relative costs,
                                as well as emissions constraints and/or carbon prices, the model simulates
                                mitigation. The typical question that JRC-EU-TIMES can address is what
                                technologies are competitive under various policy scenarios.
                                For emerging technologies with a small uptake, JRC-EU-TIMES can
                                estimate what technology improvements would be needed to make
                                these competitive (Nijs et al., 2018).

                            <p>
                                According to its analytical paradigm, the JRC-EU-TIMES model computes a dynamic
                                inter-temporal partial equilibrium for the (multi-) regional energy and
                                emission markets, based on the maximisation of total surplus defined as the
                                sum of surplus of the suppliers and consumers. In other words, it is assumed
                                that the multi-regional system evolves, while maintaining intra and
                                inter-temporal partial economic equilibrium, and always occupies the
                                technical possibility frontier. The process of solving the model determines
                                the optimal mix of technologies (capacity and activity) and fuels at each period,
                                the associated emissions, the mining and “trading activities”, the quantity and
                                prices of all commodities, all in time series from the base year to the
                                time horizon of the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most relevant model outputs are the annual stock and activity of energy supply
                                and demand technologies for each region and period. This is accompanied by
                                associated energy and material flows including emissions to air and fuel
                                consumption, detailed for each energy carrier. Besides technical outputs,
                                the associated operation and maintenance costs, the investment costs for
                                new technologies, all energy and materials commodities prices (including
                                for emissions if an emission cap is considered), are obtained for every time step.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                JRC-EU-TIMES combines a social approach towards the time value of money and
                                a private approach towards risk as well as the cost of financing based on
                                the individual technologies. The JRC-EU-TIMES model uses a mix of private
                                and social discount rates, since for the evaluation of investment decisions
                                private discount rates are used, but for the timing of investment a social
                                discount rate is applied. The first determines whether an investment pays
                                off with the assumed private discount rate. The higher the (perceived) risk is,
                                the higher the discount rate. Technologically specific discount rates are used
                                to balance planning approaches and include risks for specific technologies.
                                The second determines when is the best timing to do investments reflecting
                                the time preference for consuming as well as a decreasing marginal utility of
                                future consumption. This discount rate is applied primarily to make intertemporal
                                decisions based on Net Present Value (Nijs et al., 2019).

                                The JRC-EU-TIMES model is “by paradigm” a technology rich tool where techno-economic
                                information is assigned to each process (existing and future) of the system,
                                and therefore many datasets/parameters can be extracted and reported.

                                In line with this concept JRC-EU-TIMES monitors cost evolution of a large subset of
                                technologies from the upstream (e.g. costs of primary resources), transformation
                                (e.g. electricity and hydrogen production), and final consumption (e.g. end-use
                                sectors technologies; as appliances, cars, etc.).

                                As for all TIMES-based models, JRC-EU-TIMES can consider policies that affect
                                either the entire energy system, sectors, group of technologies/commodities,
                                or single technologies/commodities. For example, the following policies can be
                                implemented:
                            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                                <li>Carbon emissions constraint or a carbon price (imposed as a tax) in each region
                                    that it represents, or alternatively all regions simultaneously.
                                </li>
                                <li>Subsidies/capital grants on specific sets technologies (e.g. on solar PV).</li>
                                <li>Constraints on the availability of particular technologies (e.g. “no nuclear”,
                                    variable renewables accounting for no more than 50% of electricity generation).
                                </li>
                                <li>Constraints on the growth rates of particular technologies (e.g. carbon capture
                                    and storage power generation capacity cannot grow at more than 20% per year).
                                </li>
                                <li>Inter-regional emissions trading (such as the EU Emissions Trading System
                                    - EU ETS).
                                </li>
                                <li>Technology standards (e.g. efficiency labelling or ban of specific technologies).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For JRC-EU-TIMES the most commonly applied policies include:
                            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                                <li>Feed-in Tariffs and green certificates on renewable technologies.</li>
                                <li>Renewable targets in gross final energy consumption (e.g. in line with
                                    EU Renewable Energy Directive RED).
                                </li>
                                <li>Emission targets (e.g. the EU Effort Sharing Regulation - ESR).</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, the structure of the JRC-EU-TIMES may allow (although some modelling
                                expansion is required <sup>16</sup>) the exploration of energy security concepts,
                                with the possible analysis of scenario variants and policies related to
                                criticalities across sensitive corridor hubs (i.e. EU REACCESS project<sup>17</sup>),

                                            policy routes. R&D priority should be given to those technologies that
                                            are in any case deployed rapidly across the modelled time horizon
                                            (as PV) as this could significantly reduce the energy system costs,
                                            but also to those that are deployed up to their maximum technical
                                            potentials and that are typically less sensitive to exogenous
                                            policy routes (as hydro and geothermal). For these ‘no regret’
                                            technologies, R&D efforts could be mainly directed to increase
                                            their technical potential for implementation. For yet 'sensitive'
                                            to exogenous policy routes technologies (as CSP and marine),
                                            efforts should be assigned to improving their techno-economic
                                            characteristics such as capacity factors or associated costs.
