                            <p>
                                The NEMESIS model (New Econometric Model of Evaluation by
                                Sectoral Interdependency and Supply) is a sectoral detailed
                                macroeconomic model for the European Union (Boitier et al.
                                2018). It is a system of economic models for every European
                                country (including the United Kingdom), devoted to study issues
                                that link economic development, competitiveness, employment and
                                public accounts to economic policies, and notably all
                                structural policies involving long term effects.
                                The essential purpose of the model is to provide a
                                consolidated framework to realise “Business As Usual"
                                (BAU) scenarios (or other alternative scenarios),
                                up to 30 to 40 years, and to assess the socioeconomic
                                impact of the implementation of all additional
                                policies not already implemented in the BAU.
                                The main mechanisms of the model are based on the behaviour of
                                representative agents: firms, households,
                                government and rest of the world. From the supply side,
                                the model distinguishes 30 different economic activities
                                that produce goods and services through production
                                functions and, to do so, use production factors: capital,
                                energy, low and high-qualified labour and other intermediate consumption.
                                All these economic activities are interrelated by
                                inter-sectoral exchanges (conversion matrices)
                                and external trades with other EU countries and the rest of the world.
                                NEMESIS includes a detailed energy-environment
                                module that allow the model to deal with climate mitigation policies,
                                at EU and EU-national level. This module enhances the representation
                                of the energy-system of each Member
                                State by detailing the energy used
                                (ten different products) by each economic activity but also by households.
                                It also details the power generation sector
                                by allocating electricity production
                                between different technologies through diffusion curves.
                                CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion (FFC) are then calculated from fossil
                                fuel consumption whereas other GHGs
                                (CO2 from others sources, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6) are either calculated by
                                the model (however more roughly than CO2 from fossil fuel combustion) or
                                calibrated on external studies. Furthermore, the model can be relatively easily
                                linked to other tools. In case of a linkage with more detailed energy-system models,
                                NEMESIS is then used to assess the socioeconomic impacts at EU and EU-national level,
                                with detailed characterisation of the energy-system being delegate to the detailed
                                energy models.

                                in each EU Member State, but in each country the economy is divided in 30 different
                                economic activities of which: one for agriculture, fisheries and forestry, six for
                                utilities, thirteen for manufacturing activities, one for construction, three for
                                transport activities and six for services (see Table 21).

                                The NEMESIS model is designed to deliver outputs in annual step.
                                NEMESIS with its level of detail requires a big consolidated
                                database for its functioning. Data are compiled from numerous
                                sources (Eurostat, 2018; WIOD - Timmer et al., 2015; EEA, 2019;
                                etc.) and are post-processed for ensuring their whole accounting coherency.
                                Thus, the dataset used by the model are frequently updated.
                                Currently the model is calibrated for the year 2014, but for some data, historical
                                value goes up 2017, such as for energy consumption and GHG emissions and the model
                                can deliver output up to 2050.

                            <p>
                                On the supply side, each sector is modelled as a representative firm determining its
                                production level and the use of production factors (Capital, low- and high-qualified
                                labour, energy and other intermediate consumptions) given its expectations on demands
                                and prices. Nested CES production functions are used to characterise the production
                                technology with substitution elasticity coming from econometric works or from
                                literature (see Figure 11, see below). Price setting is defined under
                                monopolistic competition, with constant margin rates, different among
                                sectors and inter-sectoral exchanges are captured by conversion matrices that
                                allocate the intermediate consumption (input-output matrices) and investment
                                demands to economic activities producing the required goods and services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Regarding households, final consumption is calculated as follows: (i) firstly,
                                the aggregate consumption is computed based on the real disposable income;
                                (ii) then, the aggregate consumption is allocated among 27 consumption purposes
                                of durable and non-durable goods. The income that is not consumed results in
                                savings, which are split between investment in real estate and financial or
                                monetary assets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The labour market is modelled on the basis of the demand for labour, depending
                                on the optimisation of production levels done by firms, and its supply, which
                                is based on population’s age and qualification levels (approximated using
                                education levels). Wages are determined by augmented Philipps curves<sup>19/sup>, and
                                they are calculated separately for high- and low-qualified workers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for international trade, each EU country exports to (and imports from)
                                two groups of trade partners: intra-EU and extra-EU countries. The determinants
                                of trade are the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods and services,
                                capturing the competitiveness effect, and the volume of exchanges, which is
                                approximated by sectoral demand for goods and services. Different prices are
                                set for intra-EU and extra-EU exports (and imports), to account for the
                                differences in trade costs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Regarding public finances, the model incorporates both subsidies and the main
                                forms of taxation, such as taxes on production and imports, including most
                                notably VAT, taxes on incomes and wealth, social contributions, and taxes on
                                capital. VAT rates are modelled on the basis of the actual VAT rates
                                (as published by European Union, DG TAXUD, 2019). Carbon price can also be
                                introduced in the model and different recycling options can be assessed.
                                Finally, public finance is relatively detailed allowing the model to
                                provide indicators on government’ expenditures, incomes and balances.

                                Besides economic core, the model includes a detailed energy-environment module. For
                                each economic activity, the energy demand (E in Figure 11) is split,
                                thanks to a nested CES function, in ten different energy sources (electricity,
                                oil, gas, solid fuel, biomass including wood, biogas, biofuel and other biomass,
                                geothermal and industrial and urban wastes). Furthermore, the “electricity”
                                sector is not modelled as other sectors, there exists a specific modelling
                                for power generation in order to properly represent energy mix capability in
                                power generation. For this purpose, fourteen different power generation
                                technologies are distinguished, namely: nuclear, hydro, gas, oil,
                                solid fuel, wind (onshore and offshore), geothermal, solar
                                (large scale PV), industrial waste and biomass and waste.
                                Nuclear and hydroelectric power generation technologies are set exogenous because,
                                this setting is assumed to reflect more energy policy choices of each EU member
                                state than only pure economic choices. Other production sources are endogenous
                                and are modelled through diffusion curves (logistic function).

                                From the energy consumption calculated, the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel
                                combustion can be quantified. For other emissions, except for land use
                                emissions, either exogenous values coming from external studies are
                                assumed or a basic modelling with emissions coefficient indexed on
                                emitting economic activity is used (as detailed as the model allows)<sup>20</sup>.

                                As the geographical coverage of the model is limited to the EU, the
                                model does not include emissions impacts on climate such as radiative
                                forcing. The model can only implement climate change mitigation policies on
                                the basis of GHG emissions targets. Finally, currently the model does not
                                currently include neither impact of climate change on the economic activity

                                The socioeconomic dimension is essential in the NEMESIS, as on the one hand, it
                                serves as drivers (exogenous variables) of the modelling simulations and on the
                                other hand large a part of the model outputs concern socioeconomic variables.
                                European demographics, particularly working age population, the economic context
                                outside the EU (including GDP growth), exogenous financial variables and labour
                                hypotheses<sup>21</sup> are the main drivers of the model whereas EU GDP growth is an
                                output
                                of the model. Nevertheless, in several multi-model analyses of climate change
                                mitigation options, the socioeconomic characterisation of scenarios already
                                includes GDP projections as in the case for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways or
                                SSP, (Riahi et al., 2017) including three sets of GDP projections (Cuaresma, 2017;
                                Dellink et al., 2017 and Leimbach et al., 2017). Thus, when such socioeconomic
                                characterisation exists the model can be constrained in order to replicate, as
                                close as possible, the EU GDP projections.

                                The first set of inputs required by NEMESIS is related to European demographics.
                                This is essential to define the labour force and then the state of the labour
                                market, and, to a lesser extent, its influence on the households’ final
                                consumption. For NEMESIS, the demographic data include population by age
                                groups and by qualification for each EU country. The age groups that are
                                distinguished are: [0-14], [15-24], [25-54], [55-64], [65-74] and [75-max].
                                Furthermore, demographic data for NEMESIS required the level of qualification,
                                it is measured from two different levels of educational attainment:

                            <p>
                                Historical data come from Eurostat (2017) while, usually,
                                population projections by age group come from Eurostat (2018b); however
                                alternative population projections (with short-term adjustments to ensure
                                consistency between historical data and projections) can be used, including
                                the SSPs (KC and Lutz, 2017) that feature projections by qualification levels
                                (educational level attainment).

                                In NEMESIS, the capital market is not modelled and the interest and exchange rates
                                are both exogenous. It is therefore necessary to describe the financial context in
                                which the EU economies are expected to operate in future years. These assumptions
                                can be modified for scenarios including specific evolutions on interest or exchange
                                rates. In the model, while all variables are defined in euros, the exchange rates are
                                defined (i) between the euro and the Rest of the World currencies and (ii) between
                                the euro and the currencies of the EU countries that do not belong to the Eurozone.
                                These assumptions are based on external studies, mainly focusing on the €/$ exchange
                                rate. For interest rates, that are relevant mainly for the user cost of capital and
                                agents' accounts, projections are also based on external studies or on specific
                                assumptions related to the scenario definition.

                                The Rest of the World (non-EU countries) regions are not directly modelled in
                                NEMESIS and it is necessary to make assumptions on the evolution of global
                                demand for the different products and on global prices of the different
                                commodities that are traded by EU countries. Generally, the exogenous variables
                                representing the demands for the EU coming from the rest of the World are
                                calculated from the WIOD2016 dataset (Timmer et al., 2015). The methodology
                                uses the World Input-Output Table (WIOT), which retraces the inter-industrial
                                exchanges between sectors, with also the geographical origin of the products
                                used. The combination of these matrices with assumptions on the growth of GDP
                                in the different countries outside EU allows to calculate vectors of addressed
                                demands per country and per sector. The expected growth of GDP for non-EU countries
                                are exogenously defined and based on external studies, SSP scenario could be used
                                here or alternatively, GDP for non-EU countries and even sectoral value added if
                                available could come from other models, as a part of an operational linkage between
                                a global macroeconomic model and NEMESIS.

                                The second set of exogenous variables correspond to the price of the imported goods
                                and services from the rest of the World defined for each country and sector. These
                                are defined exogenously on the basis of past trends or on external studies when
                                available.

                                The last set of exogenous variables defining the general context of the World
                                economy is related to the prices of raw materials and notably of fossil fuels
                                (oil, gas and coal). Here again, fossil fuel prices could be an element of
                                linkage between a global IAM, in which fossil fuels market are modelled, and
                                the NEMESIS model.

                                The parameters of behavioural equations are either estimated by econometrics works
                                or calibrated. It is the case for the production factors (capital, labour, energy
                                and intermediate consumption), for households’ consumption purposes or the wage
                                equation that describes, roughly, the labour market functioning. Even if a large

                                Usually, there exists two different possibilities for the NEMESIS model to deal
                                with climate change mitigation actions either using the model including the
                                energy and environment module or using NEMESIS linked with other modelling tools,
                                typically more detailed and accurate to assess these actions, especially
                                energy-system models. In the first case, climate change mitigation essentially
                                corresponds to complying with a pre-defined annual GHG emissions binding target
                                through the implementation of economic instruments in the model, such as carbon
                                prices. In the second case, climate change mitigation policies are implemented
                                (at least partially, when the linkage concerns only specific sectoral tools) in
                                the soft-linked tool(s). This inter-linkage aims at expressing climate change
                                mitigation costs as calculated by the coupled tool(s) in the NEMESIS model and it
                                requires significant work to ensure consistency between variables exchanged
                                among all tools, including in particular a proper interpretation of the meaning
                                of these variables. Some of past studies of both settings are included in Table 23.

                                Finally, and more particularly when NEMESIS is used as a standalone model, i.e.
                                without linking it with other modelling tools, the implementation of climate change
                                mitigation options requires the definition of assumptions on the policy design, on
                                the economic instruments implemented and on what is happening in the rest of the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The model can deal with different economic instruments for the implementation of
                                climate change mitigation in the EU: “universal” carbon prices, sectoral and/or
                                nationally differentiated carbon prices, support to “green” technologies, permit
                                allocation with different allocation rules, etc. According to the economic
                                instruments implemented, it is also necessary to define the recycling scheme
                                of the potential revenues produced by a new taxation (or the origin of the
                                resources in the case of public financial supports), such as reduction of other
                                taxes or financial compensation to economic agents, etc. All these aspects must
                                be defined in the design of the scenario, because they will impact the outputs of
                                the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beside internal EU policy, it is also important to define what is happening in the
                                rest of the world. Indeed, the characterisation of the socioeconomic impacts of
                                mitigation options implemented in the rest of the world is required either on
                                the basis of exogenous assumptions or drawing from results of interlinked global
                                modelling tools, as it affects the output of the NEMESIS model, as presented in
                                Section 3.5.4.3. For instance, a unilateral implementation of a stringent climate
                                change mitigation policy in EU can have negative impacts on the competitiveness of
                                EU firms and can even lead to new design of policy options in the EU, such as carbon
                                border tax or free permit allowance in the EU emissions trading system (ETS).

                                            The report provides a comprehensive overview of analyses enabling
                                            definition of a trajectory of values to be taken into account if
                                            we are to achieve the goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050 in France.
                                            Among other analyses, a multi-model analysis has been achieved using
                                            two different kind of models: macroeconomic models and energy-system
                                            models. Finally, the report recommends, for 2030, to put forward a
                                            shadow price of €250 per ton of CO2e. By 2050 it is expected to align
                                            with the estimated costs of the enabling technologies required for
                                            decarbonisation —therefore a cautious range of €600 to €900/ton of CO2e.

                                            mechanisms. The results show that the implementation of a tax on
                                            the carbon content of EU importations can reduce the negative impacts

                                            The paper assesses whether renewable energy deployment in Europe can
                                            provide a “triple dividend”, at which ambition levels of 2030 RES
                                            targets, and what the role of the support policy scheme for electricity
                                            is. It applies two types of models: a detailed techno-economic
                                            sectoral model of the deployment of RES and two macroeconomic models.
                                            Our findings suggest that up to 2030 our triple-dividend hypothesis
                                            holds even under a declining role of Europe as a technology provider
                                            for the rest of the world. More ambiguous is the order of magnitude
                                            of the effects on GDP and employment, which differs noticeably
                                            depending on the economic theory applied in the different models.
                                            Nevertheless, both models predict slightly higher GDP and employment
                                            in 2030 when implementing ambitious RES targets.

                                            France up to 2035. The quantification has been done with the support of
                                            different modelling tools (sectoral energy system, global energy-system,
                                            macroeconomic model). Three scenarios have been quantified: a
                                            reference scenario including existing policy instruments; a more
                                            ambitious scenario, as regards of GHG emissions mitigation
                                            including additional policy measures; and a very ambitious
                                            scenario with reinforced GHG mitigation policies.
                                            These are used as benchmark scenarios for the
                                            French climate policies. Here, the NEMESIS model
                                            has assessed the socioeconomic impact of the two ambitious scenarios in
                                            terms of GDP, employment and detailed economic activity.

                                            carbon budget by 2050. Seven large-scale energy-economy models, are
