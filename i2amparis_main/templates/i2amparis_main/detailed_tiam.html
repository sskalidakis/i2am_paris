                                TIMES is a modelling platform for local, national or multi-regional energy systems,
                                which provides a technology-rich basis for estimating how energy system operations
                                will evolve over a long-term, multiple-period time horizon (Loulou and Labriet,
                                2007). These energy system operations include the extraction of primary energy
                                such as fossil fuels, the conversion of this primary energy into useful forms
                                (such as electricity, hydrogen, solid heating fuels and liquid transport fuels),
                                and the use of these fuels in a range of energy service applications (vehicular
                                transport, building heating and cooling, and the powering of industrial
                                manufacturing plants). In multi-region versions of the model, fuel trading between
                                regions is also estimated. The TIMES framework is usually applied to the analysis
                                of the entire energy sector, but may also be applied to the detailed study of
                                single sectors (e.g. the electricity and district heat sector). The framework can
                                also be used to simulate the mitigation of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases,
                                including
                                methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O).

                                The TIMES Integrate Assessment Model, TIAM, is the multi-region, global version of
                                TIMES, which combines an energy system representation of fifteen different regions
                                with options to mitigate non-CO2 greenhouse gases as well as non-energy CO<sub>2</sub>
                                mitigation
                                options, such as afforestation in each of these regions. It uses emissions from these
                                sources to calculate temperature changes using a simple climate module. As such, it
                                can be used to explore a variety of questions on how to mitigate climate change
                                through energy system and transformations, as well as reductions in non-energy
                                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

                                TIAM is a technology-rich model; based on the TIMES energy system modelling
                                framework, TIAM features a detailed representation of services and technologies
                                in the energy sector (see the figure below).

                                The time horizon over which TIAM simulates the evolution of the energy system is
                                divided into a user-chosen number of time-periods. In the TIAM version to be used
                                in PARIS REINFORCE, a starting period of 2005 is selected, with further periods
                                including 2006-7, 2008-2015 (called 2012), and then ten-year periods of 2016-2025
                                (2020), 2026-2035 (2030), and so on, until 2096-2105 (2100). All years in a given
                                period are considered to be identical. For all quantities such as installed
                                technology levels, power plant capacities and energy and emission flows, any annual
                                input quantity (e.g. coal used in a power plant per year) or output quantity (e.g.
                                electricity generated from the coal plant per year) related to a given time period
                                applies identically to each year in that period.

                                In addition to the multi-year time periods described above, in TIAM there are time
                                divisions within a year, called “time slices”, which may be deﬁned by the user, so
                                as to capture different weather and energy demand conditions at different times of
                                the year. Currently, there are six time-slices, representing summer daytime, summer
                                night time, winter daytime, winter night time, and “transition season” day time and
                                night time. Time slices are especially important whenever the mode and cost of
                                production of an energy carrier at different times of the year are signiﬁcantly
                                different (Loulou and Labriet, 2007). For instance, when the demand for electricity
                                ﬂuctuates across the year and a variety of technologies may be chosen for its
                                production at given times of the year (such as wind power when wind resources are
                                high, and solar photovoltaics when there is a high availability of solar radiation).
                                In such cases, the matching of supply and demand requires that the activities of the
                                technologies producing and consuming the electricity be tracked—and matched—in each
                                time slice.

                                The climate module in TIAM uses emissions that are calculated within the model, as a
                                result of the energy system’s operations, as well as any mitigation of non-energy
                                CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases. The model tracks the three main sources
                                of greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and
                                nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). TIAM’s climate module calculates changes in the
                                atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O,
                                and as a consequence the change in atmospheric radiative forcing (which leads to
                                global warming) compared to pre-industrial times, and finally the temperature change
                                over pre-industrial times for the atmosphere and the deep ocean. The figure below gives a
                                graphical overview of the module‘s structure.

                                The TIAM model requires inputs concerning the degree to which energy demand, as
                                well as demand for other goods and services which result in GHG emissions (such as
                                agricultural demand) will grow over the course of the 21st century. This is achieved
                                by using various socioeconomic inputs, as described in this section.

                                Economic growth is based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways variant 2 (SSP2),
                                sometimes called the “middle-of-the-road” scenario as it generally follows recent
                                past trends in demographic, social, economic and lifestyle developments (Fricko et
                                al., 2017). TIAM specifically uses the OECD projections for SSP2. This results in a
                                growth in world Gross Domestic Product to $540 trn in 2005$ Purchasing Power Parity
                                terms, by 2100, compared to $100 trn in 2020 (Dellink et al., 2017).

                                The economic, population and sectoral growths are used to determine specific drivers
                                for the growth in energy demands in a “reference” scenario where no climate change
                                mitigation takes place. For example, the demand for the number of billion
                                kilometer-vehicles (bvkm) travelled by automobiles is based on GDP per capita,
                                whereas the growth in the demand for residential space heating is driven by the
                                number of households.

                            <p>
                                Once the drivers for the different energy demands represented by
                                TIAM are determined and quantified, the construction of the reference demand
                                scenario requires computing a set of energy service demands over the horizon.
                                This is done by choosing elasticities of demands to their respective drivers,
                                in each region, using the following general formula:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Demand = Driver <sup>Elasticity</sup>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, for example, the number of billion vehicle km travelled by automobiles,
                                bvkm, grows by a factor which is the growth in the GDP per capita in a region
                                to the power of a pre-defined elasticity:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                bvkm = (GDP/capita)<sup>Elasticity</sup>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In most cases, the elasticities (which vary over time) are less than 1, and decrease
                                over time. For example, an elasticity of 0.8 means that a 10% increase in the growth
                                of GDP per capita in a region would result in an 8% increase in billions of vehicle
                                kilometres driven. Over time this could reduce to a much smaller elasticity,
                                reflecting empirical evidence that demand for energy services such as automobile
                                transport ultimately saturates with rising incomes.
                            </p>

                                TIAM has the capability of estimating the price-based response of these energy
                                service demands to the changing conditions of scenarios in which mitigation occurs.
                                For example, if the cost of energy increases as fossil fuels are replaced by
                                renewables, then the demand for energy services would decrease. To do this, TIAM uses
                                another set of inputs, namely the price elasticities of the demands for each energy
                                service considered. TIAM can then calculate the new demands for these mitigation
                                cases.

                                for all energy carriers, and the emissions if modelled.

                                TIAM is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and low-carbon
                                technologies that are envisaged to be available for at least the first half of the
                                21st century. By simulating the substitution of low-carbon for high-carbon
                                technologies in response to their relative costs, as well as emissions constraints
                                and/or carbon prices, the TIAM model simulates mitigation. The principal energy

                                TIAM also contains a range of non-energy CO2 and non-CO2 mitigation options, albeit
                                in a relatively simplified form. For non-energy CO2, the key option is afforestation.
                                For methane (CH4), these options are:
                                <li>Farm scale digesters for manure.</li>
                                <li>Anaerobic digestion, composting, heat production, electricity generation and
                                    flaring from landfill methane.
                                </li>
                                <li>Minimisation of methane leaks from fossil fuel extraction and distribution,
                                    and/or flaring of methane to (lower global warming potential) carbon dioxide gas.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                For nitrous oxide (N2O) these options are:
                                <li>Thermal destruction of gas from adipic acid production</li>
                                <li>
                                    Catalytic reduction of gas from nitric acid production
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to the above mitigation options, the TIAM model has recently
                                been developed to simulate the deployment and operation of a range of advanced
                                technologies, including Direct Air Capture for CO2 removal and sequestration
                                (Realmonte et al., 2019) and even hyper-loop terrestrial high speed transport to
                                substitute for some domestic aviation trips (Napp et al., 2019). In principle many
                                other energy technologies could be simulated in the model.

                                TIAM simultaneously calculates the quantity of production and consumption of the
                                different “commodities” accounted for in the model. These commodities are the
                                different energy forms, the different quantities of deployed technologies, and the
                                different quantities of energy services. The price of producing a commodity affects
                                the demand for that commodity, while at the same time the demand affects the
                                commodity’s price. TIAM operates in a market-clearing manner, such that prices of
                                commodities are consistent with the supply and demand being in balance for all
                                commodities.

                            <p>TIAM most commonly operates on a perfect foresight principle, such that it has
                                knowledge of all current and future technology costs and fuel supply curves. This
                                allows it to reach a cost-minimising level of commodity production and consumption,
                                which is consistent with meeting all current and future energy demands, as well as
                                any imposed emissions constraints. The total energy system cost (including any losses
                                to consumers’ welfare as a result of energy price rises) is calculated as a Net Present
                                Value (NPV) cost of the energy system over the whole time period until 2100. A
                                “discount” factor of 5% per year is used to value the costs of the energy system at
                                different time points in the future. In other words, a cost of $100 one year in the
                                future would be equated to a cost of $95 today. This discount factor can be changed.

                                TIAM is a technology-rich tool where techno-economic information is assigned to
                                each process (existing and future) of the system, and therefore many data/parameter
                                values can be extracted and reported.

                                Key parameters to monitor, discuss and evaluate in the framework of the PARIS REINFORCE
                                project are likely to be:

                                    Fossil fuel availability and cost (i.e. supply curves) and expected production

                                TIAM predominantly works by specifying either a carbon price (imposed as a tax) or a
                                carbon emissions constraint in each region that it represents, or alternatively all
                                regions simultaneously. For example, the following further policies can be implemented:
                                <li>
                                    Minimum / maximum capacity factors on fossil fuel power generation plants
                                    (e.g. to simulate minimum or maximum desired levels of operation);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Subsidies on particular technologies (through adjusting their costs);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Constraints on the availability of particular technologies (e.g. “no nuclear”,
                                    variable renewables accounting for no more than 50% of electricity generation);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Constraints on the growth rates of particular technologies (e.g. carbon capture
                                    and storage power generation capacity cannot grow at more than 20% per year)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Inter-regional emissions trading (or no trading);
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                This allows TIAM to perform a number of policy-relevant investigations, such as:
                                <li>
                                    What are the energy system cost and energy technology and fuel mix implications
                                    of imposing emissions or climate constraints earlier or later in the century, in
                                    different regions at different times and to different levels of stringency?

                                        <li>
                                            For example, Gambhir et al. (2017) explored the cost implications of
                                            introducing delays to mitigation from 2020 to 2030, using the TIAM model
                                            and two other integrated assessment models.

                                    How are the above implications affected with and without emissions permit trading?

                                            transformation implications of India meeting a regional emissions reduction
                                            target by 2050, with and without international carbon permit trading, whilst
                                            Few et al. (2017) considered mitigation costs and feasibility with different
                                            shale gas cost and availability assumptions.

                                    socioeconomic growth, technological availability, technology costs, fossil fuel
                                    costs and availability?

                                            capture and storage so that it wasn’t available before 2050, whilst
                                            Realmonte et al. (2019) undertook a deep-dive into the energy system

                                    capacity factor constraints?
