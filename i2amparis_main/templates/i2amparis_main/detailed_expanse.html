                              <p>
                               EXPANSE is a bottom-up, technology-rich electricity system model. Two versions of the
                                  model exist depending on the research question: (1) spatially-explicit, single-year
                                  model at NUTS-3 spatial resolution and with hourly time step for Europe; and (2)
                                  national long-range capacity expansion model with in-depth uncertainty analysis. The
                                  unique feature of EXPANSE is that it applies Modelling to Generate Alternatives method
                                  (MGA) to compute and analyze large numbers of cost-optimal and near-optimal scenarios
                                  with only a single set of assumptions. The principle of MGA is to relax the
                                  cost-optimality assumption and instead define an acceptable range of total system
                                  costs to search for scenarios within this acceptable range. Thus, EXPANSE tackles the
                                  common critiques to other bottom-up technology-rich models by not only focusing on
                                  costs as the sole driver of the energy transition. In this way, EXPANSE also allows to
                                  better tackle structural uncertainty, reduce modelerâ€™s bias, and provides various
                                  alternative scenarios for policymakers.
                                </p>
                              <p>
                                  Based on the exogenous assumption, such as technology parameters and costs,
                                  electricity demand, or maximum acceptable increase in total system cost, EXPANSE
                                  generates a wanted set of maximally-different scenarios that are within the
                                  pre-defined level of acceptable costs. For each of these computer-generated scenarios,
                                  EXPANSE assesses the implications on the key decision-relevant outcomes for European
                                  regions, such as technology capacity and operation, cost, employment, greenhouse gas
                                  and particulate matter emissions, land use, regional inequality, and so on. EXPANSE is
                                  then combined with Monte-Carlo technique to quantify the associated uncertainties.

                                  The role of EXPANSE is to provide more realistic what-if scenarios of the electricity
                                  sector transition that is driven by costs as well as other socio-technical factors.

                                  The principle of MGA is to remove the objective function of cost optimization and to
                                  convert it into a constraint on acceptable total system costs. EXPANSE then uses MGA
                                  to sample a wanted number of scenarios in this space: from a handful of
                                  maximally-different scenarios to thousands of scenarios for analysis of parametric and
                                  structural uncertainty. The focus on near-optimal scenarios allows EXPANSE to
                                  represent the socio-technical energy transition more realistically than done in
                                  conventional cost-optimization models. The EXPANSE scenarios within the near-optimal
                                  space may also be more desirable by decision makers than the cost-optimal scenarios
                                  due to various objectives that are not part of the model.

                                              Decentralized renewable electricity generation (DREG) has been growing at an unprecedented pace, yet the appropriate spatial allocation and associated regional equity implications remain underinvestigated. In this study, we quantify the trade-offs between cost-efficient (least-cost) and regionally equitable DREG allocation in terms of electricity generation costs, investment needs, and DREG capacity requirements. Using the case of the ambitious and publicly-approved Swiss Energy Strategy 2050, we set up a bottom-up, technology-rich electricity system model EXPANSE with Modeling to Generate Alternatives at a spatial resolution of 2â€™258 Swiss municipalities. In order to measure regional equity implication, we adapt the concepts of the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient. We find a significant trade-off by 2035 in Switzerland: 50% increase in regional equity when allocating DREG to various Swiss regions on the basis of population or electricity demand leads to 18% higher electricity generation costs. Least-cost allocation implies concentrating DREG and associated investments to few most productive locations only. Solar PV is the key technology for increasing regional equity. We conclude that in countries with spatially-uneven DREG resources like Switzerland, any policies that focus on cost efficiency should anticipate regional equity implications in advance and, if desired, minimize them by promoting solar PV.

This paper reviews the rationale for the use of cost optimization and questions whether cost-optimal scenarios are adequate proxies of the real-world energy transition. Evidence from ex-post modeling shows that cost optimization does not approximate the real-world UK electricity system transition in 1990-2014. The deviation in cumulative total system costs from the cost-optimal scenario in 1990-2014 is equal to 9-23% under various technology, cost, demand, and discount rate assumptions. In fact, cost-optimal scenarios are shown to gloss over a large share of uncertainty that arises due to deviations from cost optimality. Exploration of large numbers of near-optimal scenarios under parametric uncertainty can give indication of the bounds or envelope of predictability of the real-world transition. Concrete suggestions are then made how to improve bottom-up energy system models to better deal with the vast uncertainty around the future energy transition. The paper closes with a reflective discussion on the tension between predictive and exploratory use of energy system models.

                                             Long-range energy scenarios are commonly used to inform national energy policy decisions. Although the scenario approach aims to expand the spectrum of futures considered, in the past energy scenarios have not been diverse enough to include less expected real-world developments. We use a bottom-up energy system model EXPANSE with Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) to assess the diversity of the existing ensemble of multi-organization, multi-model Swiss electricity supply scenarios. We show that both for 2035 and 2050 existing scenarios cover well the various possibilities in deployment of individual electricity generation technologies in terms of installed capacity or produced electricity. When analyzing scenarios as a whole, we find that in 2035 there is a lack of scenarios with high electricity demand and greater deployment of renewable technologies occurring simultaneously, as well as scenarios with a negligible or negative share of net electricity import. In 2050, there is also a lack of scenarios that depict high electricity demand and conservative deployment of new renewable technologies, especially solar PV. We propose six additional scenarios to be included to increase the diversity of the ensemble of Swiss electricity supply scenarios and achieve better understanding of the future possibilities and uncertainties.
