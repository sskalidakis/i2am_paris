                                        <p>This diversity of tools is an asset for the PARIS REINFORCE project and, in
                                            order to make efficient use of them, we must inform on their potential
                                            uses for climate policy support. Evidently, not all questions can be
                                            equally addressed by all models, nor will all models that can address a
                                            specific question give similar answers. It should be noted that, although
                                            four models are based on detailed technological and sectoral approaches,
                                            the last one, NEMESIS, is a macroeconomic model that is a detailed
                                            sectoral model, but of which econometrics and granularity do not allow for
                                            an explicit characterisation of technologies. The policy issues to be
                                            addressed by the models are mitigation of GHG emissions and adaptation to
                                            climate change. However, the tools are better suited for studying
                                            mitigation options than they are for delving into adaptation.

                                            This section begins with the presentation of the main drivers, or
                                            exogenous variables, such as socioeconomic assumptions or energy prices
                                            and others that are essential inputs for the modelling simulations. Once
                                            defined, the mechanisms involved in each model in the mitigation scenarios
                                            (and, for the EU-TIMES model, some adaptation measures) are defined. After
                                            considering these drivers and mechanisms, we take stock of policy
                                            instruments that can be implemented in each model either directly or after
                                            specific modelling adjustments. We also look at the capability of the
                                            model outputs to track sustainable development goals (SDGs). Thereafter,
                                            we summarise how each model calculates a mitigation pathway. Finally,
                                            potential interlinkages are discussed, towards effectively exploiting the
                                            complementarities among the documented models and respective analyses.

                                        <p>Before exploring the capabilities of the five models, we first present here
                                            the main drivers and exogenous assumptions necessary for the modelling
                                            simulations. All five models share a common set of drivers, namely GDP,
                                            population and fossil fuel price projections (except GDP in EU in NEMESIS,
                                            and population in ALADIN). The GDP and population projections are used to
                                            define the socioeconomic context, such as the shared socioeconomic
                                            pathways (SSP) scenarios (Riahi et al., 2017). The population projections
                                            should also consider the number of households (FORECAST, LEAP and EU-TIMES) and
                                            household size (LEAP and EU-TIMES), whereas, in the NEMESIS model, population
                                            projections should be characterised by age group and educational
                                            attainment level, as in SSP population projections (KC and Lutz, 2017).
                                            The sector-specific models require in addition more precise economic data
                                            than GDP projections. The FORECAST, EU-TIMES and LEAP models require some
                                            projections of sectoral economic activities, and particularly for the
                                            industrial and tertiary sectors in FORECAST. Furthermore, the EU-TIMES model
                                            also uses macroeconomic variables, such as private consumption to proxy
                                            the evolution of households’ disposable income that drives their energy
                                            demand.

                                            Beside socioeconomic assumptions, technological specifications are also
                                            drivers of all five models, including for vehicle drive technologies in
                                            ALADIN (which also uses detailed datasets on drivers’ profile and

                                            CCS. For heat generation, only EU-TIMES and LEAP cover biomass and geothermal,
                                            but no CCS option is available.

                                            In the buildings sector, the energy system models, FORECAST, EU-TIMES and LEAP,
                                            cover a large range of climate change mitigation measures. The NEMESIS
                                            model includes mitigation options in the built environment as well, but
                                            these are less detailed. Finally, the FORECAST model includes a very high
                                            degree of detail for space heating and cooling and residential and
                                            tertiary sector appliances, allowing for in-depth analysis of mitigation
                                            measures in the European built environment.

                                            In the road transport sector, the ALADIN and EU-TIMES models cover almost all
                                            mitigation measures, with a significant degree of detail in ALADIN in
                                            particular. LEAP and NEMESIS also cover numerous options (gas vehicles,
                                            electric vehicles or biofuels) except for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in
                                            both models and hybrid electric vehicles in LEAP. The technological
                                            options for GHG emission reductions in aviation and shipping are
                                            relatively limited in all five models. The NEMESIS, LEAP and EU-TIMES models
                                            allow biofuel substitution whereas electric engines are possible only in
                                            LEAP and EU-TIMES. More precisely, biofuels, hydrogen, electricity and gas (for
                                            shipping only) are only available in the EU-TIMES model, with a few
                                            modifications. Railways electrification is also available in EU-TIMES, LEAP and
                                            NEMESIS. Finally, modal shift can be used to favour low-carbon transports,
                                            through exogenous assumptions, in EU-TIMES, whereas in NEMESIS, the granularity
                                            of the model only allows modal shifts for households (distinguishing
                                            households’ demand for road, rail, air and other transport services).

                                            For the manufacturing sectors, the FORECAST model includes more than 80
                                            processes and 200 different saving options allowing for an in-depth
                                            analysis of mitigation measures and pathways. EU-TIMES and LEAP cover almost
                                            all mitigation measures listed in the table below, except for hydrogen in process
                                            heat for the EU-TIMES model and options for machine drives in LEAP. NEMESIS
                                            also covers different options but due to non-explicit technological
                                            specification, these are more limited.

                                        <p>
                                            To mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture, NEMESIS and LEAP cover
                                            emission reductions from energy use whereas, the EU-TIMES model directly
                                            incorporates behavioural changes.

                                            Finally, in all models and for all sectors, efficiency measures can be
                                            used as GHG mitigation options with a different degree of detail and
                                            mostly as exogenous assumptions in the NEMESIS model.

                                        <p>Among the five emissions mitigation policy instruments listed in the table above, all
                                            models can deal with carbon tax or carbon price (except for LEAP), with
                                            annual emissions targets or quota (except for FORECAST and with some
                                            adaptations for ALADIN), with multi-annual emissions targets or quota,
                                            regulations and financial support (with some modifications for ALADIN and
                                            NEMESIS).</p>
                                        <p>The models also cover five energy policy instruments. All can implement
                                            energy taxation and/or energy subsidies and can fix an energy mix target
                                            (except for ALADIN and with some modifications for FORECAST and NEMESIS).
                                            Similarly, it is possible to fix efficiency targets in all models (but it
                                            will imply modifications in ALADIN, FORECAST and NEMESIS). All models
                                            (NEMESIS with some modifications) can use regulation instruments (e.g.
                                            norms), such as, thermal regulations in buildings or bans on diesel cars
                                            in urban areas.
                                            Two land policy instruments can be activated in the EU-TIMES model if some
                                            modifications are done: a carbon sink pricing or land use change emissions
                                            tax and an afforestation target.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Finally, the EU-TIMES and NEMESIS models can implement both carbon border tax on
                                            imports and carbon border support on exports (with some modifications for
                                            NEMESIS); while the implementation of trade regulation policies—based for
                                            instance on certifications, best available technologies or standards—can
                                            be incorporated in ALADIN and EU-TIMES (assuming some modifications).</p>

                                        <p>The bottom-up models, ALADIN and FORECAST, are able to provide indirect
                                            measures related to SDG7, SDG9 and SDG12. ALADIN considers innovation in
                                            technology and infrastructure that can be useful for SDG9 (industry,
                                            innovation & infrastructure). More specifically, the FORECAST model can
                                            consider the detailed impact of innovation (superior to technology
                                            readiness level 5 - TRL5) on CO2 emissions and energy demand for the
                                            industrial sectors, and can calculate the differential of investment
                                            between scenarios. FORECAST can deliver insights on SDG7 on affordable and
                                            clean energy, to the extent of considering potential use of renewables on
                                            the demand side. FORECAST can also give useful information for sustainable
                                            cities and communities (SDG11) by considering the impact of increased
                                            secondary production on CO2 emissions and energy demand.</p>
                                        <p>Both energy system models, LEAP and EU-TIMES, are able to provide information
                                            for SDG6 on clean water and sanitation, by quantifying water consumption
                                            (and withdrawal for EU-TIMES). Both are also well-designed to deliver several
                                            indicators related to SDG7 and particularly concerning renewable and clean
                                            energy sources. Furthermore, EU-TIMES can mobilise a macroeconomic module
                                            (requiring some modelling adjustments), and provide GDP deviation between
                                            scenarios, which is useful for SDG8 (decent work and economic growth).
                                            EU-TIMES
                                            quantifies system (energy-related) costs and investment needs that can be
                                            used to track SDG9, while it can also implicitly provide indicators
                                            related to the SDG11, considering the building stock and subsets of
                                            retrofit measures.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, NEMESIS, as a macroeconomic model, is well-designed to provide
                                            indicators related to SDG8 on, for example, annual growth rate of real GDP
                                            per capita; annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person; average
                                            hourly earnings of employees or unemployment rate by educational level.
                                            NEMESIS also delivers indicators for SDG7, such as renewable energy share
                                            in gross inland energy consumption; energy intensity in terms of primary
                                            energy and GDP. As granularity of industrial economic activities is
                                            relatively large in NEMESIS, the model can give insights into SDG9,
                                            through indicators on manufacturing value added, manufacturing employment
                                            or CO2 emissions per unit of value added. Finally, it can compute the
                                            labour share of GDP, a useful indicator for SDG10 on inequalities. </p>
                                        <p>Beyond the capability of the five models to provide indicators for the
                                            SDGs, some are indirectly considered in the model through scenario
                                            assumptions or drivers. For example, NEMESIS takes into account, as
                                            drivers, the level of education attainment of the population, and
                                            therefore considers some aspects of SDG4 (on education) in its scenario
                                            design. Similarly, the EU-TIMES model considers afforestation and exploitation
                                            patterns as input for renewable potentials, which are indirect elements of
                                            SDG15 (life on land). </p>

                                            Furthermore, they are all limited by their geographical coverage (EU and

                                            large set of mitigation options as well as policy instruments as detailed
                                            below. These tools will be used individually in the PARIS REINFORCE
                                            project, providing a large scope of quantitative outputs. There will exist
                                            some overlapping in the results of the models allowing for an enrichment
                                            of the analysis by comparing modelling outputs. However, the five models
                                            can be complementary also due to their different focus: NEMESIS covers
                                            macroeconomic aspects as inter-sectoral economic exchange; LEAP and EU-TIMES
                                            cover the entire energy system allowing for balancing between supply and
                                            demand and a detailed analysis of technological options; FORECAST provides
                                            for in-depth analysis of mitigation options in the industrial, tertiary
                                            and residential sectors; and ALADIN completes the puzzle with a very
                                            detailed analysis of alternative road vehicles diffusion. Thus, it seems
                                            very relevant to establish a linkage process between these tools trying
                                            (i) to provide a harmonised background for all five tools, (ii) to ensure
                                            coherency in the implementation of the tools and (iii) to take advantage
                                            of the specific expertise of each tool.</p>
                                        <p>At this step, no formal linkage has been established and the following figure only
                                            draws a first attempt on how this linkage could be implemented. Starting
                                            from scenario storylines and related quantitative drivers that feed all
                                            models in a harmonised manner, macroeconomic indicators (such as GDP,
                                            households’ disposable income, etc.) and sectoral economic activity will
                                            be calculated by the NEMESIS model and will be used as drivers in the
                                            others tools. In a first round, energy system models (EU-TIMES and LEAP) will
                                            determine demand, supply and particularly energy prices of which the
                                            latter will be used as input for sectoral “energy-demand” models (FORECAST
                                            and ALADIN). From this first iteration, new energy demands from industry
                                            and buildings (FORECAST) and new vehicle fleets (ALADIN) are estimated and
                                            then used in energy-system models (EU-TIMES and LEAP). When models’ outputs
                                            converge , economic variables (changes in investment requirements from
                                            energy supply and demand side, changes in energy expenditures, etc.) and
                                            new energy prices will be implemented in NEMESIS to assess the
                                            macro-sectoral impacts. A complete loop can be achieved when using new
                                            outputs of the NEMESIS model to feed the other modelling tools (ALADIN,
                                            FORECAST, EU-TIMES and LEAP).</p>

                                            Regarding the use of national and regional models for Europe, like all
                                            climate-economy models, a legitimate question has been raised, both in the
                                            literature and in the policy world, around the levels of trust that people
                                            (whether scientists, policymakers, or other stakeholders) should have in
                                            these models and their outputs (Doukas and Nikas, 2020). That is,
                                            especially, considering the underlying assumptions driving them (Kelly and
                                            Kolstad, 1999) and uncertainty ranges (Doukas et al., 2018), as well as the
                                            extent to which these are communicated alongside the results.

                                            It is unavoidable that models, such as those documented in I2AM PARIS,
                                            cannot provide a complete representation of the world, owing to the fact
                                            that in many ways the future is unknown, and furthermore there is incomplete
                                            knowledge of past dynamics governing energy, agricultural, land and
                                            environmental systems that are represented by these models.

                                            Despite this challenge, these models are intended to be trusted, and seen as
                                            useful and valid, by both the scientific community and—equally if not more
                                            importantly—stakeholders such as policy- and decision-makers, who will plan
                                            low-carbon strategies on their basis. Here we briefly detail the steps that
                                            have been applied in developing and using the models, as well those that
                                            will be applied in the context of the PARIS REINFORCE project, in order that
                                            such trust and validation is achieved.

                                            In particular, very early in the project the consortium has put significant
                                            effort in documenting each of the employed models’ capabilities, in terms of
                                            geographic disaggregation, sectoral representation, types of greenhouse gas
                                            and pollutant emissions accounted for, technological detail, policy
                                            representation, socioeconomic inputs and outputs, and representation of
                                            metrics relevant to non-climate SDG indicators. It has done so for every
                                            national/regional model for Europe in the consortium, (a) in detailed and
                                            technical format for experts’ consideration (see <a
                                                href="http://paris-reinforce.epu.ntua.gr/detailed_model_doc/nemesis">here</a>),
                                            (b) in a dynamic interface and easy-to-digest language for non-experts to
                                            comprehend and map their requirements onto (see <a
                                                href="http://paris-reinforce.epu.ntua.gr/dynamic_doc/nemesis/?format=_alternative_3">here</a>),
                                            and (c) in a comparative setting, allowing all stakeholders to understand
                                            which models should be employed for which policy questions (as in this
                                            page). As part of this step, the project released and shared with
                                            stakeholders a policy brief on ‘what can our models do?’ (<a
                                                href="https://paris-reinforce.eu/sites/default/files/2019-11/PARIS REINFORCE Policy Brief What our models can do.pdf">link</a>).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Second, as with global models and models for countries/regions outside the
                                            EU, the EU regional/national modelling approach is in line with the
                                            “prolonged nature of model validation” (Barlas, 1996). This approach
                                            integrates opinions from the scientific community with the perspectives of
                                            stakeholders and external experts that will ultimately use the model
                                            results. PARIS REINFORCE will, in this respect, undertake active engagement
                                            with national and EU stakeholders aimed at communicating what the models
                                            are, as well as what they can do, including a presentation of the modelling
                                            approach, preliminary results, and a discussion of the types of inputs and
                                            outputs the models produce and how they do this. This interaction will
                                            therefore provide an opportunity to place our models’ results in the context
                                            of previous results from other EU-wide and national low-carbon pathways
                                            modelling activities. They will also allow the project, not only to clearly
                                            communicate the modelling capabilities, features, and questions they have
                                            been asked to address in the past, but also to co-create the most pertinent
                                            questions stakeholders would like the models to address in the context of
                                            PARIS REINFORCE, in light of this well-informed stakeholder perspective. The
                                            project workflow involves first undertaking global, regionally-disaggregated
                                            modelling to explore the regional dynamics of emissions and
                                            energy/agricultural and land system transitions globally, before discussing
                                            the realism, feasibility and validity of such results with both global and
                                            regional stakeholders. In this way, global models can undertake scenarios
                                            informed by national stakeholders in Member States and various regions
                                            around the world, improving the real-world relevance of their outputs.

                                        <p>
                                            Third, a central aspect of achieving real-world relevance is to undertake
                                            basic harmonisation/benchmarking of the models, via targeted validity
                                            checks. This includes ensuring that base-year emissions, socio-economic
                                            assumptions, policies, and energy/agricultural/land system representations
                                            are in line with the most up-to-date verified information, and that such
                                            inputs are to the extent possible harmonised across the models used in a
                                            multi-model analysis; this is not to strip models of their invaluable
                                            diversity in the way they behave in response to specific stimuli as well as
                                            the theoretical foundations underpinning them, but quite the contrary to
                                            allow the consortium to later map the resulting ranges onto this diversity
                                            rather than uncertainties associated with ad hoc inputs assumed for each
                                            model. This also includes technology costs and performance variables. The
                                            underlying detailed protocol for achieving this has been documented in
                                            Giarola et al.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Fourth, “diagnostic” tests are and will be run for each model, to check that
                                            its responses to key input variable changes, such as stringency of climate
                                            policy (as represented by emissions targets, carbon prices, or combinations
                                            thereof), are in line with common expectations and compared to other results
                                            and models covering the same/similar regions and/or a priori defined
                                            stylised behaviours. For models covering the EU and its countries, this
                                            includes (a) comparing the resulting ranges of the multi-model exercises to
                                            those of similar studies looking at the EU, for example (Capros et al.,
                                            2014) for similar multi-model analyses or (Simoes et al., 2017) for focused
                                            single-model EU-regional analyses; (b) comparing the resulting ranges of the
                                            multi-model exercises to those of the global model inter-comparisons carried
                                            out with appropriate disaggregation at the European region, e.g. (Sognnaes
                                            et al.); and (c) carrying out index decomposition analysis of sectoral
                                            modelling results against the global IAM results (e.g., Wachsmuth and
                                            Duscha, 2019). These checks will build on the normal standard practice
                                            undertaken by each modelling group to regularly check the model code and
                                            ensure that errors/bugs are identified and eliminated, and to report the
                                            model’s performance alongside its results.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Finally, this evaluation process will be carried out in an iterative process
                                            throughout the project. It will be documented to ensure that models perform
                                            without unexplained dynamics in both reference and mitigation cases. A key
                                            element of this will be in taking documented modelling results back to
                                            stakeholders in the second half of the project, when they will be able to
                                            understand the behaviours of the models under increasingly stringent
                                            mitigation scenarios, and to ask why the models respond in the way that they
                                            do.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In combination, these evaluation steps cover the primary elements of the
                                            workflow suggested by Schwanitz (2013) on model validation. The models’
                                            conceptual framework has to a large extent already been evaluated (and will
                                            be clearly communicated with stakeholders) as following from a principle of
                                            identifying least-cost pathways to low-carbon futures given the
                                            technological other input assumptions (like technology constraints,
                                            socio-economic dynamics, and representations of policies). The I2AM PARIS
                                            platform is intended to represent a major advance in communicating in a
                                            clear, accessible and attractive way the features, objectives, coverage,
                                            capabilities and limitations of models. Such documentation has been and will
                                            be accompanying our stakeholder interactions. Model structure and responses
                                            are being tested through both diagnostics as well as comparisons with other
                                            published low-carbon and reference case pathways. Whilst most modelling
                                            groups explicitly draw on a vast range of literature and comparative studies
                                            to understand the extent to which their results are similar to or different
                                            from others, and if so why, in PARIS REINFORCE we will explicitly undertake
                                            and present such comparisons throughout our modelling, to help better build
                                            trust in the results and the models themselves.
