                          <p>
                              E3ME (https://www.e3me.com/) is a macro-econometric model with substantial sectoral
                              detail at the Member State level, which captures interlinkages between the energy,
                              economic and environmental systems. E3ME was originally developed through the European
                              Framework Programme and has since been enhanced to become one of the key tools available
                              for Impact Assessment in the EU. Because of its existing capability and geographical
                              coverage (61 regions including the EU27+UK at the national level), E3ME is well-placed to
                              assess the potential positive and negative impacts of a wide range of policies in the
                              European Union and beyond.
                          </p>
                              <p>
                                  E3ME’s core post-Keynesian economic framework has been expanded to include bottom-up
                                  models of technology diffusion in the energy sector (power, road transport, and
                                  heating system in buildings). These detailed, bottom-up, technology diffusion
                                  sub-modules are based on the Future Technology Transformation (FTT) methodology
                                  developed by Jean-Francois Mercure. For instance, FTT: Power uses a behavioural
                                  approach to determine the power mix that will generate electricity as its
                                  decision-making core mimics investors wanting to build new electrical capacity.
                                  The diffusion model makes decisions based on final energy demand and constrained by a
                                  global database of renewable and non-renewable resources. The choice of technology
                                  used depends partly on costs but also on how well the technology is already
                                  established. The other FTT models cover passenger transport, household heating and the
                                  steel sector.

                              E3ME's economic module is shown in the below figure and is solved for each region. Most
                              of the economic variables shown in the chart are solved at the sectoral level. The whole
                              system is solved simultaneously for all industries and all regions, although
                              single-country solutions are also possible. As the figure suggests, output and
                              employment are determined by levels of demand, unless there are constraints on
                              available supply. The figure shows three loops or circuits of economic interdependence,
                              which are described below. In addition there is an interdependency between the sectors
                              that is not shown in the figure. The full set of loops comprises:
                              <ol>• Interdependency between sectors: If one sector increases output it will buy more
                                  inputs from its suppliers who will in turn purchase from their own suppliers. This
                                  is similar to a Type I multiplier.</ol>
                              <ol>• The income loop: If a sector increases output it may also increase employment,
                                  leading to higher incomes and additional consumer spending. This in turn feeds back
                                  into the economy, as given by a Type II multiplier.</ol>
                              <ol>• The investment loop: When firms increase output (and expect higher levels of future
                                  output) they must also increase production capacity by investing. This creates demand
                                  for the production of the sectors that produce investment goods (e.g. construction,
                                  engineering) and their supply chains.</ol>
                              <ol>• The trade loop: Some of the increase in demand described above will be met by
                                  imported goods and services. This leads to higher demand and production levels in
                                  other countries. Hence there is also a loop between countries.</ol>

                              Policy assessments, including Impact Assessment at European level requires an analysis of
                              economic, social and environmental impacts. In quantitative modelling, the assessment of
                              social impacts is often largely ignored. This is partly due to a lack of quantitative
                              indicators but also that it often does not fit well into the basic structure of most
                              macroeconomic models. Like other models, E3ME is able to provide less coverage of social
                              factors than economic factors (see above) and environmental impacts but social factors are
                              not ignored completely. The main social indicators in the model are:
                              <ol>• sectoral employment and working hours;</ol>
                              <ol>• sectoral wage rates;</ol>
                              <ol>• unemployment; and</ol>

                              Technological progress plays an important role in the E3ME model, affecting all three E’s:

                              <ol>• The model’s endogenous technical progress indicators (TPIs), a function of R&D and
                                  gross investment, appear in nine of E3ME’s econometric equation sets including trade,
                                  the labour market and prices.</ol>
                              <ol>• Investment and R&D in new technologies also appears in the E3ME’s energy and
                                  material demand equations to capture energy/resource savings technologies as well
                                  as pollution abatement equipment.</ol>
                              <ol>• In addition, E3ME also captures low carbon technologies in the power, road

                              <p>Economic activity undertaken by persons, households, firms and other groups in society
                                  has effects on other groups after a time lag, and the effects persist into future
                                  generations, although many of the effects soon become so small as to be negligible.
                                  But there are many actors and the effects, both beneficial and damaging, accumulate
                                  in economic and physical stocks. The effects are transmitted through the environment
                                  (with externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming),
                                  through the economy and the price and money system (via the markets for labour and
                                  commodities), and through the global transport and information networks. The markets
                                  transmit effects in three main ways: through the level of activity creating demand
                                  for inputs of materials, fuels and labour; through wages and prices affecting
                                  incomes; and through incomes leading in turn to further demands for goods and
                                  services. These interdependencies suggest that an E3 model should be comprehensive
                                  and include many linkages between different parts of the economic and energy
                                  systems.</p>
                              <p>E3ME is often compared to Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. In many ways
                                  the modelling approaches are similar; they are used to answer similar questions and
                                  use similar inputs and outputs. However, underlying this there are important
                                  theoretical differences between the modelling approaches. In a typical CGE framework,
                                  optimal behaviour is assumed, output is determined by supply-side constraints and
                                  prices adjust fully so that all the available capacity is used. </p>
                              <p>In E3ME the determination of output comes from a post-Keynesian framework and it is
                                  possible to have spare capacity. The model is more demand-driven and it is not
                                  assumed that prices always adjust to market clearing levels. The differences have
                                  important practical implications, as they mean that in E3ME regulation and other
                                  policy may lead to increases in output if they are able to draw upon spare economic
                                  capacity. This is described in more detail in the model manual. The econometric
                                  specification of E3ME gives the model a strong empirical grounding.  E3ME uses a
                                  system of error correction, allowing short-term dynamic (or transition) outcomes,
                                  moving towards a long-term trend.  The dynamic specification is important when
                                  considering short and medium-term analysis (e.g. up to 2020) and rebound effects,
                                  which are included as standard in the model’s results.</p>

                                              The authors find that emission transfers between OECD and non-OECD
                                              countries peaked in 2006, and have been declining since. The reversal is
                                              principally due to the reduction in the emissions intensity of traded
                                              goods, rather than the volume of trade. A more recent decline in
                                              embodied emissions transfers is also observed in trade between developing
                                              countries. Using E3ME to model a Nationally Determined Contribution
                                              scenario, the authors find that absolute embodied emissions are expected
                                              to plateau at current levels or slowly return to pre-2008- crisis levels
                                              , and differences between the NDC and baseline scenarios imply that NDC
                                              policies will not result in significant carbon leakage.

                                              The authors find that the effects of modelling zero-process emission pathway of the European iron and steel industry depend strongly on the technology choice, the prevailing macroeconomic states as well as regional characteristics. The underlying socioeconomic development and the climate policy trajectory, with a to date expected range of variation, seem to play a less important role. Particularly, the authors find that the choice of model, with its underlying macroeconomic theory, influences the sign and magnitude of macroeconomic effects and thus should be well understood by both modellers and policymakers. The paper argues that model assumptions should be transparent, results sought to be derived across a range of possible contexts, and presented together with the conditions under which they are valid.
