                                  PROMETHEUS is a global energy system model covering in detail the complex interactions
                                  between energy demand, supply and energy prices at the regional and global level. Its
                                  main objectives are: 1) Assess climate change mitigation pathways and low-emission
                                  development strategies for the medium and long-term 2) Analyse the energy system,
                                  economic and emission implications of a wide spectrum of energy and climate policy
                                  measures, differentiated by region and sector) 3) Explore the economics of fossil fuel
                                  production and quantify the impacts of climate policies on the evolution of global
                                  energy prices. The PROMETHEUS model provides detailed projections of energy demand,
                                  supply, power generation mix, energy-related carbon emissions, energy prices and
                                  investment to the future covering the global energy system. PROMETHEUS is a fully
                                  fledged energy demand and supply simulation model aiming at addressing energy system
                                  analysis, energy price projections, power generation planning and climate change
                                  mitigation policies. PROMETHEUS contains relations and/or exogenous variables for all
                                  the main quantities, which are of interest in the context of general energy systems
                                  analysis. These include demographic and economic activity indicators, primary and
                                  final energy consumption by main fuel, fuel resources and prices, CO2 emissions,
                                  greenhouse gases concentrations and technology dynamics (for power generation, road
                                  transport, hydrogen production and industrial and residential end-use technologies).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                PROMETHEUS quantifies CO2 emissions and incorporates environmentally oriented emission
                                  abatement technologies (like RES, electric vehicles, CCS, energy efficiency) and
                                  policy instruments. The latter include both market based instruments such as cap and
                                  trade systems with differential application per region and sector specific policies
                                  and measures focusing on specific carbon emitting activities. Key characteristics of
                                  the model, that are particularly pertinent for performing the analysis of the
                                  implications of alternative climate abatement scenarios, include world supply/demand
                                  resolution for determining the prices of internationally traded fuels and technology
                                  dynamics mechanisms for simulating spill-over effects for technological improvements
                                  (increased uptake of a new technology in one part of the world leads to improvements
                                  through learning by experience which eventually benefits the energy systems in other
                                  parts of the World).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                PROMETHEUS is designed to provide medium and long term energy system projections and
                                  system restructuring up to 2050, both in the demand and the supply sides. The model
                                  produces analytical quantitative results in the form of detailed energy balances in
                                  the period 2015 to 2050 annually. The model can support impact assessment of specific
                                  energy and environment policies and measures, applied at regional and global level,
                                  including price signals, such as taxation, subsidies, technology and energy efficiency
                                  promoting policies, RES supporting policies, environmental policies and technology
                                  standards.

PROMETHEUS quantifies CO2 emissions and incorporates environmentally oriented emission abatement technologies (including renewable energy, electric vehicles, Carbon Capture and Storage, energy efficiency, electrification, green hydrogen, advanced biofuels) and energy and climate policy instruments. The latter include both market based instruments such as cap and trade systems with differential application per region and sector specific policies and measures focusing on specific carbon emitting activities. Key characteristics of the model, that are particularly pertinent for performing the analysis of the implications of alternative climate abatement scenarios, include world supply/demand resolution for determining the prices of internationally traded fuels and technology dynamics mechanisms for simulating spill-over effects for technological improvements (increased uptake of a new technology in one part of the world leads to improvements through learning by experience which eventually benefits the energy systems in other parts of the World). PROMETHEUS is designed to provide medium and long term energy system projections and system restructuring up to 2050 (and 2100), both in the energy demand and the supply sides. The model produces analytical quantitative results in the form of detailed energy balances in the period 2015 to 2050 annually (to be expanded to 2100). The model can support impact assessment of specific energy and environment policies and measures, applied at regional and global level, including price signals, such as taxation, subsidies, technology and energy efficiency promoting policies, RES supporting policies, environmental policies and technology standards.

The PROMETHEUS model is organized in sub-models (modules), each one representing the behaviour of a representative agent, a demander and/or a supplier of energy. The figure below presents a simplified summary flow chart of the PROMETHEUS model. The main modules are:
                                  <ol>
                              <li>The demographic and economic activity module, which projects population and activity growth for each region.</li>
                              <li>The fossil fuel supply module that includes oil and gas resources, while coal is assumed to have abundant supplies relative to production prospects at least for the projection time horizon</li>
                              <li>The biomass supply module, which contains technical and economic potential for biomass per region and their effects on biomass costs.</li>
                              <li>The cost-supply curves for renewable energy sources (RES) module.</li>
                              <li>The fuel prices module projecting both international and final consumer prices, with the latter being differentiated for each demand sector. Global fossil fuel prices are determined from the equilibrium of fuel demand and supply at the global level.</li>
                              <li>The final energy demand module, projecting energy demand and fuel mix in three main sectors; industry, transport and residential/services/agriculture sector. The following energy forms are considered as options in the final demand sectors: natural gas, oil, coal, biofuels, electricity, steam and hydrogen. The private passenger cars sector is modelled in detail, by distinguishing the following types of passenger cars: internal combustion engine cars (using gasoline, diesel, biofuels or hydrogen as a fuel), conventional and plug-in hybrids, electric cars and fuel-cell cars (using hydrogen or gasoline as a fuel).</li>
                              <li>The electricity generation module, identifying 26 power generation technologies and their competition to cover electricity demand for base, medium and peak load.</li>
                              <li>The hydrogen production sub-model, identifying 18 hydrogen production options</li>
                              <li>The hydrogen storage and delivery module, including 16 different technological options in order to represent in detail the development of hydrogen infrastructure.</li>
                              <li> The technology dynamics module, which endogenises technical progress through both learning by research and learning by experience (“learning by doing”) mechanisms.</li>
                              <li>The technology diffusion module incorporating network effects accelerating spillovers between regions in cases where technology uptake attains critical levels</li>

                                  The PROMETHEUS model estimates in detail carbon dioxide emissions, as emerging from
                                  fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes.
                                  The model directly covers all emissions from the energy sector and the industry sector
                                  and can split CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by sector (transport, industry, buildings,
                                  power generation, refineries, international bunkers, other) and by fuel (coal, oil,
                                  natural gas). The model is currently expanded to represent non-CO2 GHG emissions
                                  (including CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and F-gases) through specific marginal
                                  abatement cost curves per region and sector.
                                  Energy and climate policies affect these emissions: energy CO<sub>2</sub> is derived
                                  from the changes in the energy sector induced by the policy, other emissions are
                                  affected by marginal abatement cost curves.
                                  The model has been used extensively to study climate change mitigation scenarios, see
                                  References section for the most recent examples.

                              <p>
                                  PROMETHEUS is a recursive dynamic energy system simulation model. Variables are either
                                  calculated directly or are calculated based on the previous years' values, to which
                                  are applied the evolution of explanatory variables and other exogenous parameters.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The economic decisions regarding the investment and operation of the energy system are
                                  based on the current state of knowledge of parameters (costs and performance of
                                  technologies, prices, ...) or with a myopic anticipation of future costs and
                                  constraints. The model does not use foresight but myopic anticipation. Some foresight
                                  can be forced in the electricity production sector. The core operating principle of
                                  the PROMETHEUS model is that of market equilibrium. The representative agents in the
                                  modules use information on prices and make decisions about the allocation of
                                  resources. They represent, for example, regional electricity sectors, regional
                                  refining sectors, regional energy demand sectors. Markets are the means by which
                                  these representative agents interact with one another. The model solves for a set of
                                  market prices so that supplies and demands are balanced in all these markets across
                                  the model ; in other words, market equilibrium is assumed to take place in each one
                                  of these markets (partial equilibrium), and not in the entire economy across all
                                  markets (general equilibrium). The solution process is the process of iterating on
                                  market prices until this equilibrium is reached. The regional fuel markets are also
                                  integrated to form an international (global or regional) market equilibirum for crude
                                  oil, natural gas and coal.

                                              Contributions (NDCs) and the global emissions levels needed to achieve the
                                              Paris Agreement’s climate goals will likely require a comprehensive
                                              package of policy measures. National and sectoral policies can help ll the
                                              gap, but success stories in one country cannot be automatically replicated
                                              in other countries, but need to be adapted to the local context. Here, we
                                              develop a new Bridge scenario based on nationally relevant measures
                                              informed by interactions with country experts. We implement this scenario
                                              with an ensemble of global integrated assessment models (IAMs). We show
                                              that a global roll-out of these good practice policies closes the
                                              emissions gap between current NDCs and a cost-optimal well below 2 C
                                              scenario by two thirds by 2030 and more than fully by 2050, while being
                                              less disruptive than a scenario that delays cost-optimal mitigation to
                                              2030. The Bridge scenario leads to a scale-up of renewable energy
                                              (reaching 50%-85% of global electricity supply by 2050), electri cation of
                                              end-uses, e ciency improvements in energy demand sectors, and enhanced
                                              afforestation and reforestation. Our analysis suggests that early action
                                              via good-practice policies is less costly than a delay in global climate
                                              cooperation.
