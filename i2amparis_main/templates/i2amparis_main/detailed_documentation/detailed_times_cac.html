                                as described in Section 3.6.1. The integrated bottom-up partial-equilibrium
                                energy system model of the Central Asian Caspian (CAC) Area, titled TIMES-CAC,
                                assembles the four separate but structurally-consistent single-region TIMES

                                The key components of the TIMES-CAC model are the
                                technologies for the production of primary and
                                secondary commodities (mining and extractions

                                residential, commercial, industry, and transportation.

                                is divided into a user-chosen number of time periods. In its default (current)
                                version, the model runs from 2011 (base year) to the medium-to-long term through
                                six periods (the representative years of which are: 2011, 2013, 2020, 2030, 2040,
                                and 2050). All years in a given period are considered identical. For all quantities,
                                such as installed technology levels, power plant capacities and energy and emissions
                                flows, any annual input quantity (e.g. coal used in a power plant per year) or output
                                quantity (e.g. electricity generated from the coal plant per year) related to a given
                                time period applies identically to each of the years in that period.

                                The model tracks the three main sources of GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4)
                                and nitrous oxide (N20). A special module of the TIMES-CAC model can be enabled to
                                let two more countries of the Central-Asian region (virtually modelled), to
                                participate in the GHG emission reduction effort (through a virtual market
                                trading scheme extended to four-plus-two regions of the area).

                                The TIMES-CAC model requires inputs concerning the degree to which
                                energy service demands, as well as demand for other goods and services which result
                                in GHG emissions (such as agricultural demand), will grow over the course of next
                                decades in the different countries. It does this by using various socioeconomic
                                inputs, as described in the following table (current default values) and sections.
                                Data will be revised and updated before running the model under the PARIS REINFORCE
                                project.

                                As is the case for almost all the most important energy-producing countries, the CAC
                                countries are also highly dependent on energy exports, and this dependence results
                                in a very large share of the energy sector to the GDP and fundamental (critical)
                                contributions to the State budgets. Economic growths are based on national specific
                                projections for the medium-term, and on hypotheses (study- and scenario-specific)
                                for the longer horizon. In general terms, the analysed storylines always assume a
                                (quite fast) growth in domestic GDPs for all the cases and countries, that in a
                                baseline case is equivalent to a an economic trend of around +4.5% (in terms of GDP,
                                in average, to 2050).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But due to the abovementioned characteristics, economic growths in the CAC area
                                (by country) should be always properly assessed and considered within a
                                self-consistent (energy-related) storyline, in order to keep a certain degree of
                                robustness of the scenario and of the projections.

                                Population growths are also based on national (local) specific information in the
                                medium term and on assumptions in the longer horizon (mainly inherited by a specific
                                analysis for Kazakhstan), that result in a population growth rate of +1.2%, in
                                average, in the long-term (2050), for the multiregional area. It is worth noting
                                that, according to some local experts, the international analyses often
                                “underestimate” the population growth rates of the area, due to the incorrect
                                comparison with Russia (and the Former Soviet Union) and with the Russian ethnic
                                groups (lower birth rates).

                                It should also be noted that the TIMES-CAC model can be adjusted to use other
                                socioeconomic growth projections aside
                                from the default.

                                The growth in the industrial, agricultural and retail business sectors in each region
                                is partially derived from the national’s overall GDP growth, with each sector’s share
                                of total GDP changing over time, and from the expected/planned production levels,
                                constructions (e.g. square meters for services), and development of certain
                                activities. Growth of residential households is derived from population growth and
                                assumptions on average household size in each region.

                                The TIMES-CAC model is calibrated for the initial period (currently 2011) using a
                                combination of IEA world energy statistics for the year 2011 and country-specific
                                information, with the projections for the key energy-related investments and stocks
                                (e.g. installed technology capacity) further calibrated until 2013-2015. The current
                                intention is that the version of TIMES-CAC to be used in PARIS REINFORCE will have
                                an updated energy statistics calibration (the most useful combination among the key
                                international and local sources) to the most recent years. The main variables to be
                                calibrated include: the capacities/stocks and operating levels of all technologies;
                                the extracted, exported, imported, produced, and consumed quantities for all energy
                                carriers; and the introduction/representation of recent (new) policy- and
                                target-related elements (if any).

                                TIMES-CAC is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and
                                low-carbon technologies that are envisaged to be available (for those systems)
                                for at least the first half of the 21st century. By simulating the substitution of
                                low-carbon for high-carbon technologies in response to their relative costs, as well
                                as emissions constraints and/or carbon prices, the model simulates mitigation. The
                                principal energy sector CO2 (and non- CO2) mitigation options are shown in the
                                following table (the options that are not currently available but can be added in the
                                model are marked with an asterisk*). Data will be revised and updated in the
                                framework of the PARIS REINFORCE project, and in accordance with the international
                                database and feedback of local experts.

                            <p>
                                The modelling framework and solution rationale is similar to the MAPLE and
                                NATEM models, as detailed for MAPLE in Section 3.6.7.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The TIMES-CAC model computes a dynamic inter-temporal partial equilibrium for
                                the (multi-) regional energy and emission markets, based on the maximisation of
                                total surplus defined as the sum of surplus of the suppliers and consumers. In
                                other words, it is assumed that the multi-regional system evolves, while
                                maintaining intra-temporal and inter-temporal partial economic equilibrium,
                                and always occupies the technical possibility frontier. The process of solving the
                                model determines the optimal mix of technologies (capacity and activity) and fuels at
                                each period, the associated emissions, the mining and “trading activities”, the
                                quantity and prices of all commodities, all in time series from the base year
                                to the time horizon of the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The model was mainly developed and used to assess the dynamics of the national
                                energy system of the area in cooperative and non-cooperative manner, when <b

                                per each direction of export, or with endogenously defined export levels through
                                the most profitable route and destination. A ri'>energy export levels</b> export levels are determined by the willingness-to-pay of the different

                                The model responds to economic incentives (such as revenues from the exports)
                                by optimising the domestic energy system (supply and demand of each energy form),
                                the energy exchanges within the multiregional system (CAC area), and with the
                                external markets, in an “integrated” manner. A “discount” factor of 5% per year is
                                usually used to value the costs of the energy system at different time points in
                                the future. In other words, a cost of $100 one year in the future would be equated
                                to a cost of $95 today. This discount factor can be changed. Implicit discount
                                rates are also used at sectoral level.

                                The TIMES-CAC model is “by paradigm” a technology-rich tool, where techno-economic
                                information is assigned to each process (existing and future) of the system, and
                                therefore many datasets/parameters can be extracted and reported.

                                Based on the geopolitical and strategic role of the CAC area in the international

                            <ul>
                                As for all the TIMES-based models, TIMES-CAC predominantly works by specifying
                                either a carbon price (imposed as a tax) or a carbon emissions constraint in
                                each region that it represents, or alternatively all regions simultaneously.
                                For example the following further policies can be implemented:
                                <li>Minimum/maximum capacity factors on fossil fuel power generation plants
                                    (e.g. to simulate minimum or maximum desired levels of operation);
                                </li>
                                <li>Subsidies on particular technologies (through adjusting their costs or the
                                    explicit assignment of incentives);
                                </li>
                                <li>Constraints on the availability of particular technologies (e.g. “no nuclear”,
                                    variable renewables accounting for no more than 50% of electricity generation);
                                </li>
                                <li>Constraints on the growth rates of particular technologies (e.g. carbon capture
                                    and storage power generation capacity cannot grow at more than 20% per year)
                                </li>
                                <li>Inter-regional emissions trading (or no trading);</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                More in particular, TIMES-CAC is capable of exploring the direct economic advantage
                                of cooperation policies in the energy and climate change mitigation sectors for the
                                represented countries. The following cooperation policies in the area can be directly
                                modelled:
                                <li>exploitation of Caspian oil and natural gas resources;</li>
                                <li>investment in the construction of cross-national new pipelines;</li>
                                <li>maintenance of free exchange in the energy sector across the region; and</li>
                                <li>creation of a joint CO2 emission permit system in the area.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, the structure of the TIMES-CAC model allows to fully include the
                                concept of “energy security” in the analysis (from the perspective of energy
                                exporters), and to test the effects of long-term energy export strategies in
                                the CAC region by exploring the trade-offs between a “risk” indicator and some
                                key variables of the energy system such as the total cost, the quantities exported
                                and the corresponding revenues, the climate targets of the region. Furthermore,
                                (export) risk reduction goals can be combined with securing a minimum level of
                                revenues from the hydrocarbon exports goals, with the aim to quantitatively
                                evaluate the response of the energy sector and its sensitivity to different
                                export strategies.
