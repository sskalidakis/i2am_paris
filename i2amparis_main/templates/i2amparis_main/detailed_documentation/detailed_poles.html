                              <p>The Prospetive outlook on energy systems (POLES) is a partial equilibrium model that
                                  represents detailed world energy system dynamics. It explores the interactions between
                                  the energy systems and climate. The role of POLES is put incoherence detailed
                                  informations from the supply, transformation and use of energy to provide scientific
                                  insights onthe world and detailed country level of energy decarbonsation pathways.
                                  The model components provide a faithful representation of the best current scientific
                                  understanding of underlying behaviour.</p>
                              <p>POLES allows users to explore what-if scenarios, quantifying the implications of
                                  possible future conditions. These outputs are not predictions of the future; they are
                                  a way of analysing the potential impacts of different assumptions about future
                                  conditions. POLES reads in external “scenario assumptions” about key drivers (e.g.,
                                  population, economic activity, technology, and policies) and then assesses the
                                  implications of these assumptions on key scientific or decision-relevant outcomes
                                  (e.g., commodity prices, energy use and emissions).</p>
                              <p>POLES has been used to produce scenarios for national and international assessments in
                                  the two last IPCC scenarios (sources).</p>

                              <p>POLES takes in a set of assumptions and then processes those assumptions to create a
                                  full scenario of prices, energy and other transformations, and commodity and other
                                  flows across regions and into the future. The energy, economy and climate systems are
                                  interconnected and interact with each other (see the figure below). The interactions
                                  between these different modules are modelled as one integrated whole.</p>

                                  at 66 geopolitical regions globally , 88 oil producers, gas producers, coal producers</p>

                                  It also tracks international trade in energy commodities. All the different elements
                                  of POLES interact through market prices and physical flows.</p>

                              <p>Population and economic activity are determined exogenously.</p>
                              <p><b>Industrial sector growth</b></p>
                              <p>Industrial sector growth Growth is based on a pre-defined GDP elasticity which
                                  decreases over time, thus assuming saturation of industrial demand with rising
                                  incomes. The values of these elasticities vary per region and between different SSPs.
                                  Apart from a GDP elasticity, industrial demand also depends on an assumed price
                                  elasticity for industrial energy use.</p>
                              <p><b>Transport sector growth</b></p>
                              <p>Per capita demand for passenger transport depends on an assumed GDP per capita
                                  elasticity and price elasticity, which means that more transport services are demanded
                                  at higher incomes and cheaper transport. However, there is also a time cost involved
                                  in transport, which increases proportionally with GDP per capita, and which is summed
                                  to the capital and energy costs of transport. This means that, at higher incomes,
                                  demand for passenger transport slowly saturates due to the price elasticity multiplied
                                  by the increasing costs of time. Also, demand shifts to faster ways of transport, for
                                  which time costs are lower. Demand for freight transport, like for industrial sectors,
                                  depends on an assumed GDP elasticity and price elasticity.</p>
                              <p><b>Building sector growth</b></p>
                              <p>Demand for energy services in residential and commercial buildings is primarily by
                                  total building floor space, which is driven by GDP per capita, and saturates at a
                                  given maximum value, defined per region. Per unit of floor space, demand for energy
                                  services increases over time depending on the relative price of the service, and the
                                  difference between the base year saturation and the defined maximum saturation for a
                                  certain service. For heating and cooling services, the maximum saturation depends on
                                  regionally explicit heating and cooling degree days.</p>

                              <p>POLES is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and low-carbon
                                  technologies that are envisaged to be available for at least the first half of the
                                  21st century. By simulating the substitution of low-carbon for high-carbon
                                  technologies in response to their relative costs, as well as emissions constraints
                                  and/or carbon prices, the POLES model simulates mitigation through a large set of
                                  different measures.
                                Also, certain assumption sets can be loaded from climate models for heating and cooling
                                  degree days, which are consistent with a certain temperature target. Through these
                                  assumptions, the model adapts to the simulated reality through the allocation of
                                  building service demands.

                              <p>The representative agents in the modules use information on prices and make decisions
                                  about the allocation of resources. They represent, for example, regional electricity
                                  producers or regional energy demand sectors who have to allocate generation by
                                  technology or energy demand mix. Markets are the means by which international prices
                                  are result of confrontation of demand and supply for oil, gas, coal, biomass or
                                  uranium.  In other words, market equilibrium is assumed to take place in each one of
                                  these markets (partial equilibrium), and not in the entire economy across all markets
                                  (general equilibrium). The POLES solution process is the process of recursive
                                  iterating on market prices until this equilibrium is reached.</p>
                              <p>As an example, POLES derives a demand for natural gas starting with all of the uses to
                                  which natural gas might be put, such as power generation, hydrogen production,
                                  heating, cooling and cooking, other industrial energy uses or passenger and freight
                                  transport. POLES then calculates the amount of natural gas that suppliers would like
                                  to supply given their reserves and the market price.</p>
                              <p>POLES is a dynamic recursive model, meaning that decision-makers do not know the future
                                  when making a decision today. The POLES version used is typically operated in year by
                                  year-year time steps up to 2100 as the final simulation year.</p>

                              <h4 class="mb-0 heading-new">Key policies that can be addressed</h4>
                              <p>POLES can be used to explore the implications of different future policies like :</p>
                              <p><b>Emissions-related policies</b></p>
                              <p>There are three main policy approaches that can be applied in POLES to reduce emissions
                                  of CO2 or other GHGs: carbon/GHG prices, emissions constraints, or climate
                                  constraints. In all cases, GCAM implements the policy approach by placing a price on
                                  emissions. This price then filters down through all systems in GCAM and alters
                                  production and demand. For example, a price on carbon would put a cost on emitting
                                  fossil fuels. This cost would then influence the cost of producing electricity from
                                  fossil-fired power plants that emit CO2, which would then influence their relative
                                  cost compared to other electricity generating technologies and increase the price of
                                  electricity. The increased price of electricity would then make its way to consumers
                                  that use electricity, decreasing its competitiveness relative to other fuels and
                                  leading to a decrease in electricity demand.</p>
                              <p>Carbon or GHG prices: POLES users can directly specify the price of carbon or GHG
                                  emissions. Given a carbon price, the resulting emissions will vary depending on other
                                  scenario drivers, such as population, GDP, resources, and technology.
                                  Emissions constraints: POLES users can specify the total amount of (CO2 or other GHG)
                                  emissions as well. POLES will then calculate the price of carbon needed to reach the
                                  constraint in each period of the constraint.
                                  Climate constraints: POLES users can specify a climate variable (e.g. concentration or
                                  radiative forcing) target for a particular year. Users determine whether that target
                                  can be exceeded prior to the target year.</p>
                              <p><b>Energy production policies</b></p>
                              <p>POLES can explore the implications of a constraint on production or a minimum
                                  production requirement which allows POLES users to model policies such as renewable
                                  portfolio standards and biofuels standards. Across sectors, these constraints must be
                                  applied as quantity constraints, but they can be applied as share constraints within
                                  individual sectors (e.g. fraction of electricity that comes from solar power). In
                                  implementing these policies, users can set either a lower bound or an upper bound.
                                  The model will solve for the tax (upper bound) or subsidy (lower bound) required to
                                  reach the given constraint.</p>

                                  least-cost energy system to meet prescribed climate or emissions constraints. However,
                                  it is possible to use its outputs and calculate the predictions for certain indicators
                                  framed in the SDG agenda.

                                            The health co-benefits substantially outweighed the policy cost of achieving
                                              the 2°C target. The ratio of health co-benefit to mitigation cost ranged
                                              from 1.4 to 2.45, depending on the scenario. At the regional level, the
                                              costs of reducing GHG emissions could be compensated with the health
                                              co-benefits alone for China and India, whereas the proportion the
                                              co-benefits covered varied but could be substantial in the European Union
                                              (7–84%) and USA (10–41%), respectively. Finally, we found that the extra
                                              effort of trying to pursue the 1.5°C target instead of the 2°C target
                                              would generate a substantial net benefit in India (US$3.28–8.4 trillion)
                                              and China ($0.27–2.31 trillion).

                                              To limit warming to any level, CO2 emissions at the global level must
                                              ultimately be brought to zero. If emissions are not brought swiftly to
                                              zero beyond 2100, the chances of extreme temperature change after 2100
                                              could be much higher and the chance of limiting warming to 2°C much lower.
                                              The Paris scenarios reduce probabilities of extreme warming and increase
                                              the probability of limiting global warming to 2°C this century.
