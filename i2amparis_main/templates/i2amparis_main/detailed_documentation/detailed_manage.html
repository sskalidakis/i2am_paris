                              <p>
                                  MANAGE is a (recursive) dynamic single country computable general equilibrium (CGE)
                                  model designed to focus on energy, emissions and climate change. In addition to the
                                  standard features of a single country CGE model, MANAGE includes a detailed energy
                                  specification that allows for capital/labor/energy substitution in production,
                                  intra-fuel energy substitution across all demand agents, and a multi-output
                                  multi-input production structure.
                                  MANAGE is a dynamic model, using by and large the neo-classical growth specification,
                                  where labor growth is exogenous. Capital accumulation derives from savings/investment
                                  decisions. The model allows for a wide-range of productivity assumptions that include
                                  autonomous improvements in energy efficiency that can differ across agents and energy
                                  carriers. Finally, the model has a vintage structure for capital that allows for
                                  putty/semi-putty assumptions with sluggish mobility of installed capital.
                                  The model is sufficiently flexible that it can be calibrated to a relatively large
                                  number of Social Accounting Matrices (SAM). The latest version of the model
                                  incorporates recently developed price/volume splits of the energy sectors and CO2
                                  emissions. The model is implemented in the GAMS software and an aggregation facility
                                  is used as a front-end to the model to allow for full aggregation flexibility.

                                  MANAGE uses the GTAP's database so it can be tailored to any of these countries or for
                                  a regional coalition. The GTAP's database contains 141 countries/regions comprising of
                                  121 countries that account for 98% of world GDP and 92% of world population. MANAGE is
                                  a single country model. Thus, each time, the SAM table of the region choice should be
                                  imported in the model or, in case of a regional coalition, after completing the
                                  appropriate regional aggregation on GTAP databse to extract the SAM table of the
                                  regional coalition. Note that this is in accordance to the GTAP version 10. The
                                  version 11 is under construction and its pre-released version is expected to be
                                  available containing even more new countries or countries that belong to a regional
                                  coalition.

                                  Energy goods are aggregated together into a single energy bundle that allows for
                                  substitution across the diferent energy carriers. Energy is assumed to be a
                                  near-complement with capital in the short-run, but a substitute in the long-run.
                                  The model also allows for both multi-input and multi-output production. This  would
                                  allow for electricity supply to be produced by multiple activities (thermal, hydro,
                                  solar and other renewable forms of electricity production). Energy demand is bundled
                                  into a single commodity and disaggregated by energy type using a CES structure that
                                  allows for inter-fuel substitution.

                                  The model has a single national market for land. Aggregate land supply is specified as
                                  an upward sloping supply curve. National land supply is allocated to each sector based

                                  The core baseline scenarios for MANAGE are currently calibrated to the SSP projections
                                  provided by the Integrated Assessment community, but could be adjusted based on the
                                  country specific data. Labor/population are exogenous and sources include UN
                                  Population Division, as well as  IIASA. Capital stock is also exogenous within period
                                  and it is a function of long-run savings dynamics. The baseline scenario is also used
                                  to calibrate labor productivity. The latter is allowed to differ across sectors.

                                  Currently, MANAGE's energy & technology detail is limited to the GTAP's Power Data
                                  Base. In particular, it includes transmission and distribution, as well as electricity
                                  production split into 11 sources (thermal, nuclear, hydro renewables, etc.) which are
                                  further split into base and peak load respectively. The main mtigation instrument
                                  relies on setting carbon taxes, that is, mitigation policy is limited to direct
                                  consumption. Additionally, MANAGE allows for caps on emissions. In this case, the
                                  carbon taxes are determined endogenously. Moreover, since MANAGE allows for exogenous
                                  changes in productivity, this also includes changes in energy efficiency.

                                  In MANAGE, each year of a scenario is solved as a static equilibrium, with dynamic
                                  equations linking exogenous factors across years with, in addition, update equations
                                  for productivity factors. Each static equilibria relies on a relatively standard set
                                  of equation specifications. The dynamics of MANAGE is composed of three elements
                                  (similar to most neo-classical growth models): population/labor, capital accumulation,
                                  and productivity changes, including changes in energy efficiency.
                              </p>
                              <p><b>Economic rationale</b></p>
                              <p>
                                  In general, MANAGE follows a rather standard economic flow linking production, factor
                                  income and taxes, and demand (private, public, savings, trade) under closure and
                                  equilibrium constraints.         More precisely, production structure forms a set of
                                  nested constant-elasticity-of-substitution functions, allowing for the aggregation of
                                  multiple activities, as well as for shifts in preferences (e.g. RES vs fossil fuels).
                                  Demand block consists of three final agents: households, government and investment,
                                  where each has a unique expenditutre function. Regardings their incomes, househlds
                                  derive incom from factor payments and tranfers, while government's income comes from a
                                  suite of taxes and tarrifs. Investment income is driven by savings and depreciation.
                                  Factor markets are exactly the following: labor, land, capital and natural resources.
                                  Finally, MANAGE incudes a trade block, where domestic supply is allocated across the
                                  domestic market and exports, and absorption is allocated between domestic goods and
                                  imports, implemented is fixed trade and transport margin

                                  The key features of MANAGE structure are summarized in the following:
                                  Capital/labor/energy substitution in production, intra-fuel energy substitution across
                                  all demand agents, and multi-output and multi-production structure.
                                  Moreover, dynamics of MANAGE are driven by the following key factors:
                                  Population and labor force growth rate, capital accumulation (influenced by the
                                  national savings rate, foreign savings and unit cost of investment), and productivity
                                  changes, including changes in energy efficiency.
                                  Regarding pure key modelling parameters, MANAGE like most CGE models is limited to
                                  various substitution, transformation and income elasticities.
                                  Finally, one of the key features of MANAGE is the multi-input/multi output
                                  specification allowing for the aggregation of multiple activities into a single
                                  marketed good.

                                  constituting a multi-sector CGE model with a special focus on energy, it may provide
                                  impacts of any policy shock on agricultural goods, clear energy, etc.
