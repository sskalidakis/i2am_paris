                            <p>The Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) is a global integrated
                                assessment model that represents both human and Earth system dynamics.
                                It explores the behaviour and interactions between the energy system,
                                agriculture and land use, the economy and climate. The role of GCAM is
                                to bring multiple human and physical Earth systems together in one
                                place to provide scientific insights that would not be available from
                                the exploration of individual scientific research lines. The model
                                components provide a faithful representation of the best current
                                scientific understanding of underlying behaviour.
                            </p>

                                GCAM allows users to explore what-if scenarios, quantifying the
                                implications of possible future conditions. These outputs are not
                                predictions of the future; they are a way of analysing the potential
                                impacts of different assumptions about future conditions. GCAM reads
                                in external “scenario assumptions” about key drivers (e.g.,
                                population, economic activity, technology, and policies) and then
                                assesses the implications of these assumptions on key scientific or
                                decision-relevant outcomes (e.g., commodity prices, energy use, land
                                use, water use, emissions, and concentrations).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is used to explore and map the implications of uncertainty in key
                                input assumptions and parameters into implied distributions of
                                outputs, such as GHG emissions, energy use, energy prices, and trade
                                patterns. Techniques include scenarios analysis, sensitivity analysis,
                                and Monte Carlo simulations.

                                GCAM has been used to produce scenarios for national and international
                                assessments ranging from the very first IPCC scenarios (Response
                                Strategies Working Group, 1990) through the present Shared
                                Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (Calvin et al., 2017).

                            <p>GCAM takes in a set of assumptions and then processes those assumptions
                                to create a full scenario of prices, energy and other transformations,
                                and commodity and other flows across regions and into the future. The
                                energy, agriculture and land use, economy and climate systems are
                                interconnected and interact with each other (Figure 1). The
                                interactions between these different systems are modelled as one
                                integrated whole.

                                international trade in energy commodities. All the different elements of GCAM interact
                                through market prices and physical flows of, for example, electricity.

                            <p>Within each of the land regions shown in Figure 2, land is categorised into
                                approximately a dozen types based on cover and use. In GCAM, competing uses of land
                                are nested within land nodes. Within each land node, it is generally assumed to be
                                easier to substitute products. Among arable land types, further divisions are made for
                                lands historically in non-commercial uses (forests and grasslands) and commercial land
                                uses (commercial forests and croplands). Production of approximately twenty crops is
                                currently modelled, with specific yields depending on the land region and management
                                type (with and without irrigation, high and low fertiliser).

                            <p>GCAM uses a global climate carbon-cycle climate module, Hector (Calvin et al., 2019),
                                an open-source, object-oriented, reduced-form global climate carbon-cycle model that
                                represents the most critical global-scale earth system processes. At every time step,
                                emissions from GCAM (Table 11) are passed to Hector. Hector converts these emissions
                                to concentrations and calculates the associated radiative forcing and the response of
                                the climate system (e.g., temperature, carbon-fluxes, etc.).

                            <p>Hector has a three-part main carbon cycle: a one-pool atmosphere, three-pool land, and
                                four-pool ocean (Figure 4). The atmosphere consists of one well-mixed box. The ocean
                                consists of four boxes, with advection and water mass exchange simulating circulation.
                                The high-latitude surface ocean takes up carbon from the atmosphere, while the
                                low-latitude surface ocean off-gases carbon to the atmosphere. The land consists of a
                                user-defined number of biomes or regions for vegetation, detritus and soil. The
                                vegetation takes up carbon from the atmosphere while the detritus and soil release
                                carbon back into the atmosphere. The earth pool is continually debited with each time
                                step to act as a mass balance check on the carbon system. Hector actively solves the
                                inorganic carbon system in the surface ocean, directly calculating air– sea fluxes of
                                carbon and ocean pH. It reproduces the global historical trends of atmospheric [CO2],
                                radiative forcing, and surface temperatures.</p>

                            <p>The socioeconomic components of GCAM set the scale of economic activity and associated
                                demands for model simulations. Assumptions about population and per capita GDP growth
                                for each of the 32 geo-political regions together determine the GDP. Population and
                                economic activity are used in GCAM to transfer information to other GCAM components,
                                and are determined exogenously.
                            </p>
                            <p>GCAM’s inputs include information on population and the rate of per capita income
                                growth for each of the energy-economic regions. Each scenario requires assumptions
                                about population and per capita GDP growth for future time periods, for example those
                                of the SSPs. The macro-economic module takes both of these to produce overall GDP in
                                each GCAM energy-economic region, where the regional GDP is calculated using a simple
                                one-equation model:</p>

                                Growth in industrial sectors is based on a pre-defined GDP elasticity which decreases
                                over time, thus assuming saturation of industrial demand with rising incomes. The
                                values of these elasticities vary per region and between different SSPs. Apart from a
                                GDP elasticity, industrial demand also depends on an assumed price elasticity for
                                industrial energy use.

                            <p>Per capita demand for passenger transport depends on an assumed GDP per capita
                                elasticity and price elasticity, which means that more transport services are demanded
                                at higher incomes and cheaper transport. However, there is also a time cost involved
                                in transport, which increases proportionally with GDP per capita, and which is summed
                                to the capital and energy costs of transport. This means that, at higher incomes,
                                demand for passenger transport slowly saturates due to the price elasticity multiplied
                                by the increasing costs of time. Also, demand shifts to faster ways of transport, for
                                which time costs are lower. Demand for freight transport, like for industrial sectors,
                                depends on an assumed GDP elasticity and price elasticity.

                            <p>The core operating principle for GCAM is that of market equilibrium. The representative
                                agents in the modules use information on prices and make decisions about the
                                allocation of resources. They represent, for example, regional electricity sectors,
                                regional refining sectors, regional energy demand sectors, and land users who have to
                                allocate land among competing crops within any given land region. Markets are the
                                means by which these representative agents interact with one another. Agents indicate
                                their intended supply and/or demand for goods and services in the markets. GCAM solves
                                for a set of market prices so that supplies and demands are balanced in all these
                                markets across the model (Figure 5); in other words, market equilibrium is assumed to
                                take place in each one of these markets (partial equilibrium), and not in the entire
                                economy across all markets (general equilibrium). The GCAM solution process is the
                                process of iterating on market prices until this equilibrium is reached. Markets exist
                                for physical flows such as electricity or agricultural commodities, but they also can
                                exist for other types of goods and services, for example tradable carbon permits.
                            </p>
                            <p>As an example, in any single model period, GCAM derives a demand for natural gas
                                starting with all of the uses to which natural gas might be put, such as passenger and
                                freight transport, power generation, hydrogen production, heating, cooling and
                                cooking, fertiliser production, and other industrial energy uses. Those demands depend
                                on the external assumptions about, for example, electricity generating technology
                                efficiencies, but also on the price of all of the commodities in the model. GCAM then
                                calculates the amount of natural gas that suppliers would like to supply given their
                                available technology for extracting resources and the market price. The model gathers
                                this same information for all of the commodities and then adjusts prices so that in
                                every market during that period supplies of everything from rice to solar power match
                                demands.</p>

                            <p>GCAM is a dynamic recursive model, meaning that decision-makers do not know the future
                                when making a decision today, as opposed to other optimisation models, which assume
                                that agents know the future with certainty when they make decisions. After it solves
                                each period, the model then uses the resulting state of the world, including the
                                consequences of decisions made in that period—such as resource depletion, capital
                                stock retirements and installations, and changes to the landscape—and then moves to
                                the next time step and performs the same exercise. The GCAM version used is typically
                                operated in five-year time steps with 2100 as the final calibration year. However, the
                                model has flexibility to be operated at a different time horizon through user-defined
                                parameters.</p>
                            <p>While the agents in the GCAM model are assumed to act towards maximising their own
                                self-interest, the model as a whole is not performing an optimisation calculation. In
                                fact, actors in GCAM can make decisions that “seemed like a good idea at the time”,
                                but which are not optimal from a larger social perspective and which the decision
                                maker would not have made had the decision maker known what lay ahead in the future.
                                For example, the model’s actors do not know about future climate regulations, and
                                could install fossil fuel power in the years preceding the implementation of such
                                policies. Also, stated preferences by agents for certain technologies (e.g. transport
                                modes) are calculated in the base year and such preferences are persistent into the
                                future (their evolution can be changed by the user), preventing the solution to be
                                completely cost-minimising or profit-maximising.</p>

                            <p>One of GCAM’s uses is to explore the implications of different future policies. There
                                are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Emissions-related policies:</b> There are three main policy approaches that can be
                                applied in GCAM to reduce emissions of CO2 or other GHGs: carbon/GHG prices, emissions
                                constraints, or climate constraints. In all cases, GCAM implements the policy approach
                                by placing a price on emissions. This price then filters down through all systems in
                                GCAM and alters production and demand. For example, a price on carbon would put a cost
                                on emitting fossil fuels. This cost would then influence the cost of producing
                                electricity from fossil-fired power plants that emit CO2, which would then influence
                                their relative cost compared to other electricity generating technologies and increase
                                the price of electricity. The increased price of electricity would then make its way
                                to consumers that use electricity, decreasing its competitiveness relative to other
                                fuels and leading to a decrease in electricity demand.</p>
                            <p>• Carbon or GHG prices: GCAM users can directly specify the price of carbon or GHG
                                emissions. Given a carbon price, the resulting emissions will vary depending on other
                                scenario drivers, such as population, GDP, resources, and technology.
                                • Emissions constraints: GCAM users can specify the total amount of (CO2 or other GHG)
                                emissions as well. GCAM will then calculate the price of carbon needed to reach the
                                constraint in each period of the constraint.
                                • Climate constraints: GCAM users can specify a climate variable (e.g. concentration
                                or radiative forcing) target for a particular year. Users determine whether that
                                target can be exceeded prior to the target year. GCAM will adjust carbon prices in
                                order to find the least-cost path to reaching the target.
                            </p>
                            <p>Emissions prices of different GHGs can be linked together for a multi-gas policy.
                                Additionally, markets in GCAM can be set for any emission species (e.g., CH4-only
                                market, NOx market, etc.). In addition to identifying emission prices as one measure

                            <p><b>Energy production policies: </b>There are times when users would like to explore the
                                implications of a constraint on production or a minimum production requirement. This
                                capability allows GCAM users to model policies such as renewable portfolio standards
                                and biofuels standards. Across sectors, these constraints must be applied as quantity
                                constraints, but they can be applied as share constraints within individual sectors
                                (e.g. fraction of electricity that comes from solar power). In implementing these
                                policies, users can set either a lower bound or an upper bound. The model will solve
                                for the tax (upper bound) or subsidy (lower bound) required to reach the given
                                constraint.</p>
                            <p><b>Land use policies</b></p>
                            <p>• Protected Lands: With this policy, GCAM users can set aside a fraction of natural
                                land, removing it from economic competition. This land cannot be converted to crops,
                                pasture, or any other land type. This is similar to real-world policies such as
                                reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).
                                • Valuing carbon in land: When applying a price on carbon through any of the
                                emissions-related policy approaches, GCAM users can choose whether that price extends
                                to land use change CO2 emissions. This policy is modelled as a subsidy to land-owners
                                for holding carbon stocks as opposed to a price on the emissions themselves.
                                • Bioenergy constraints: GCAM users can impose constraints on bioenergy within GCAM.
                                Under such a policy, GCAM will calculate the tax or subsidy required to ensure that
                                the constraint is met.

                            <h4 class="mb-0 heading-new">Key features of the GCAM-China model</h4>
                            <p>In GCAM-China, the 31 Chinese provinces are included as explicit regions that operate
                                within the global GCAM model (Figure 3.4). Energy transformation (electricity
                                generation and refined liquids production) and end-use demands (buildings,
                                transportation, and industry) are modelled at the individual province level, and
                                inter-province trade of all energy goods is considered. For electricity trade between
                                provinces, provinces are grouped into 6 grid regions (Figure 3.4). Whereby provinces
                                within the same sub-region can trade freely within that sub-region, trade between
                                regions may be limited. Table 3.4 shows an overview of features calibrated at the
                                country, grid and province level. The model can generate pathways through to 2100 with
                                5 year time periods.
                            </p>
                            <p>The more detailed province-level approach for China has advantages over the global
                                version of GCAM, in terms of more detailed assumptions on socioeconomic and energy
                                futures, resulting into potentially more realistic reference scenarios. Also, the
                                higher geographical granularity as advantages for policy analysis and impacts of
                                climate policies might differ strongly between provinces.

                                The GCAM model is calibrated for its base year, 2010. For international and China-wide
                                data, the same data sources are used for calibration as for the global model, which
                                are predominantly IEA energy balances for energy production and consumption, and
                                FAOSTAT balances for food demand and agriculture. For province- and grid-level data in
                                China (see Table 3.4), national Chinese data sources have been used for calibration.

                                Outcomes in GCAM depend strongly on the assumptions made for socioeconomic,
                                techno-economic, and agronomic parameters. Given the role that GCAM-China might play
                                in the PARIS REINFORCE project, some input parameters will be most relevant for the
                                model outcomes:

                                            The inclusion of new provincial CO2 storage cost curves gives a more

                                            place. The results
                                            suggest that the scale of deployment varies depending on socioeconomic
                                            development pathways and the
                                            level of deployment of other low-carbon technologies. Across provinces and
                                            development pathways,
                                            early deployment of CCUS occurs within industrial and synthetic fuel
                                            production sectors, followed by
                                            increased deployment in the power sector by mid-century. Several provinces,
                                            such as Shandong, Inner
                                            Mongolia, Hebei, and Henan, emerge as particularly important in CCUS
                                            deployment, as a result of
                                            large CO2 point sources and storage availability. Results indicate that

                                            availability is unlikely to constrain CCUS deployment in most provinces

                                GCAM-SOUSEI, like the GCAM model from which it is derived, is a multi-region global
                                model, which includes Japan as a separate region. The level of energy system,
                                agriculture and land use detail for the Japan region allows it to be used to study
                                Japan’s national-level low-carbon pathways. In addition, GCAM-SOUSEI uses emission
                                pathways that account for uncertainties in a number of climate-relevant parameters
                                relating CO2 atmospheric concentrations to global temperature changes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These emission pathways are obtained from a large set of experimental results with a
                                climate model (Earth system model of intermediate complexity, or EMIC) covering a
                                wider range of parameters and uncertainties than the original GCAM model, leading to
                                a range of CO2 emissions being associated with each temperature change target.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The climate model in GCAM-SOUSEI emulates the Earth system, covering the range of
                                values of physical and biogeochemical parameters indicated by multiple Earth System
                                Models (ESMs), which are highly complex and detailed models used to analyse the global
                                changes of the atmosphere, the land and the ocean (the original GCAM model includes a
                                simple climate model called the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced
                                Climate Change, or MAGICC).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The emission pathways for allowable carbon emissions translate into lower total energy
                                consumption, shift from high shares of fossil fuels to larger shares of renewables and
                                nuclear energy, as well as the increase in CCS penetration. Also, larger amounts of
                                bioenergy crops result in conversion of unmanaged land (pastures, arable land among
                                others) into land for bioenergy crops.

                                The GCAM model was expanded to include greater spatial detail in the USA region,
                                referred to as GCAM-USA. GCAM-USA is built within the GCAM framework. Hence
                                assumptions in GCAM-USA are made in the same way as the rest of the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In GCAM-USA, the 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia (hereafter, the 51
                                states) are included as explicit regions that operate within the global GCAM model
                                (Figure 3.6). Energy transformation (electricity generation and refined
                                liquids production) and end-use demands (buildings, transportation, and industry) are
                                modelled at the individual state level, and inter-state trade of all energy goods is
                                considered. For electricity trade between states, states are grouped into the 13 NEMS
                                Electricity Market Module Regions (EIA 2010), plus Alaska and Hawaii (Figure 3.6).
                                Whereby states within the same sub-region can trade freely within that sub-region,
                                trade between regions may be limited. Also, prices for final energy commodities
                                (except for biomass products) are calibrated per grid region, reflecting regional
                                differences in energy prices. Table 3.6 shows an overview of features calibrated at
                                the country, grid and state level.

                                The more detailed state-level approach for the USA has advantages over the global GCAM
                                model, in terms of more detailed assumptions on socioeconomic and energy futures,
                                resulting into potentially more realistic reference scenarios. Also, the higher
                                geographical granularity has advantages for policy analysis, as climate policies often
                                vary by state in the USA, and impacts of climate policies might differ strongly
                                between states.

                                The GCAM model is calibrated for its base year, 2010. For international and USA-wide
                                data, the same data sources are used for calibration as for the global model, which are
                                predominantly IEA energy balances for energy production and consumption, and FAOSTAT
                                balances for food demand and agriculture. For state- and grid-level data in the USA
                                (see Table 3.5), the State Energy Data System from the EIA (2014) is used as the
                                primary dataset. Socioeconomic data are calibrated for 2015 at the state-level,
                                reflecting data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

                                Outcomes in GCAM depend strongly on the assumptions made for socioeconomic,
                                techno-economic, and agronomic parameters. Given the role that GCAM-USA might play in
                                the PARIS REINFORCE project, some input parameters will be most relevant for the model

                                            pathways modelled in this study produce higher particulate matter-related
                                            mortality costs due to greater use of biomass in residential heating.

                                            The United States has developed a Mid-Century Strategy to reduce
                                            economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 80% or more below 2005
                                            levels by 2050. Achieving these reductions will entail a major
                                            transformation of the energy system, including the electric power sector.
                                            The scenarios in this study include substantial decarbonisation of the
                                            electric power sector, increased electrification of end-use sectors, and
                                            increase in the deployment of low- and zero-carbon technologies such as
                                            renewables, nuclear and carbon capture utilisation and storage. The
                                            results show that the degree to which the electric power sector will need
                                            to decarbonise depends on the nature of technological advances in the
                                            energy sector, and the degree to which end-use sectors electrify.

                                            of existing infrastructure as well as the magnitude of increase in demand.
                                            The results also illustrate the risks of under-utilisation of pipeline
                                            capacity, in particular, under a scenario characterised by long-term
                                            systemic transitions toward a low-carbon economy. More broadly, this study
                                            highlights the value of integrated approaches to facilitate informed
                                            decision-making.

                                ALADIN is an agent-based simulation model for assessing the market diffusion of
                                alternative fuel vehicles (AFV). The acronym ALADIN stands for ALternative Automobiles
                                Diffusion and INfrastructure. To date, the simulation comprises the market diffusion of
                                passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles in Germany and Europe until 2050. The simulation
                                is
                                based on driving data of several thousand individual vehicles that are treated as agents
                                purchasing new vehicles. Changes in prices, user preferences, and model availability
                                lead
                                to market evolution for fuels and vehicles in road transport.

                                The simulation model ALADIN calculates the market diffusion of AFVs based on a
                                comparison of the economic efficiency of different drive systems and considering
                                obstructive and supportive factors for approximately 6,500 driving profiles. The
                                successive approach allows the effects of individual influencing factors on market
                                evolution to be analysed separately and thus makes it more transparent.

                                The costs of buying and using a vehicle of course play an important role for potential
                                buyers when making a purchasing decision. In commercial fleets, the economic aspects
                                are even more important. Compared to conventional cars, AFV are generally more
                                expensive to purchase, but they are often cheaper to run because of lower fuel and
                                maintenance costs, among other things. It is therefore essential to look at costs in
                                terms of the total use, in order to determine for which utilisation or driving
                                profiles electric cars are more economical than conventional ones. Total cost
                                calculations for vehicles are correspondingly a common component of models of market
                                penetration of electric vehicles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The model consists of three basic steps (Figure 2). In a first step, the costs of
                                total use, referred to as TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), are ascertained for
                                alternative and conventional vehicles. The TCO comprise the purchase and operating
                                costs for the respective vehicle and are calculated from a user’s perspective. Three
                                user groups are distinguished—private, commercial (only fleet vehicles) and company
                                cars—because of their different rates of taxation and depreciation options as well as
                                their deviating patterns of utilisation. Because the TCO are also strongly influenced
                                by the size of the vehicle, different car segments are also distinguished.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The drive technologies analysed included battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in
                                electric vehicles (PEV), range-extended vehicles (REEV), plug-in hybrids (PHEV), CNG
                                vehicles and fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV) as well as conventional gasoline and
                                diesel vehicles. For the TCO calculations, the cheapest respective drive technology is
                                selected.

                                One of the key innovations of ALADIN compared to previous TCO analyses is that the
                                calculations are not made based on average annual mileages but are instead based on
                                real-life driving profiles. A driving profile covers all the trips including the
                                purpose, length of route, departure and arrival time, duration as well as information
                                about the vehicle over an observation period of at least one week. Profiles vary
                                widely by user even within the different groups and have a very strong influence on
                                the economic efficiency of electric vehicles. The barrier presented by BEV’s limited
                                range is explicitly considered in the analyses; each individual driving profile is
                                analysed according to whether the driver is able to make all the trips with a BEV. In
                                addition, the electric driving share of PHEV or REEV is simulated individually for
                                each driving profile. This is important to obtain realistic results on economic
                                efficiency, which depends on the share of electric driving and is especially relevant
                                for PHEV and REEV. The first step, therefore, is to make TCO calculations on this
                                basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the second step, the TCO calculations are extended by including the costs of the
                                main charging infrastructure. This is done in order to put the assessment of the
                                economic efficiency in the TCO calculations on a broader basis. Charging
                                infrastructure costs vary widely depending on the charging type and location. For
                                instance, using private charging infrastructure is generally cheaper for drivers with
                                a garage than for drivers using public charging infrastructure, on which on-street
                                parkers have to rely. Because the methodology is a simulation which does not represent
                                spatial modelling but only trip purposes (such as for example “going home”, “going to
                                work”, “going shopping”), statements about the infrastructure are only possible to a
                                limited extent. The infrastructure assumption made is the same for all users in the
                                respective user group. Depending on the scenario, car users are provided with a
                                different amount of charging infrastructure (for example, only charging at home for
                                private users and only charging at work for commercial users). In terms of costs,
                                however, only the primary charging point (e.g. the private wall box of garage owners)
                                is classified.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The brand and size of a vehicle are also important factors influencing the decision to
                                buy. For instance, many buyers are extremely loyal to a particular brand. There will
                                continue to be a restricted range of models and brands of electric vehicles available
                                in the near future, which represents a limiting factor for the market evolution of
                                electric vehicles. The restricted choice and availability of brands are therefore
                                taken into account in the model. This is done by analysing currently offered models of
                                electric vehicles and the announcements made about planned new ones. Logistic growth
                                in the number of available makes with BEV or REEV/PHEV drives is then determined on
                                this basis using ordinary least squares regression. It is also assumed that some
                                buyers decide in favour of an EV of a different brand (if an EV has ideal TCO) and the
                                rest for a conventional vehicle of the original brand. The most important factors
                                obstructing market diffusion of electric vehicles are taken into account with the
                                economic efficiency, range anxiety and limited offer of electric vehicles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fourth and final step then integrates other aspects of electric vehicles, which
                                tend to support their market penetration, for example environmental friendliness, low
                                noise emissions or the allure of an innovative technology. These supportive aspects
                                are integrated in the model for private users via the willingness to pay more.
                                Experience shows that the admission of a willingness to pay a higher price in
                                questionnaires is not the same as actually observed purchasing behaviour.
                                Nevertheless, it does provide first indications of the esteem attached to new
                                technologies and the approximate magnitude of the willingness to pay more for them.
                                The approach of taking the willingness to pay a higher price is a common one in market
                                diffusion models of AFVs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this final step, the market evolution is modelled for AFV in Germany up to 2050.
                                The driving profiles at which an AFV becomes economically viable are determined for
                                each year based on the analyses conducted. The evolution of the market is then
                                determined by extrapolating the share of these users in newly registered vehicles.
                                Monetary policy measures are also integrated into the model such as purchase bonuses,
                                for example, and their impacts on the evolution of the market are quantified.

                            <p>
                                The market diffusion of passenger cars in Europe is based on the projected diffusion
                                in Germany and combined with country specific factors. We fit logistic functions to
                                model-based predictions for Germany, for the period 2017-2030 and transfer them to
                                the other European countries with modifications according to the national electricity
                                and gasoline price ratio. The basic rationale is to use current market shares as
                                starting point and modify the logistic market diffusion according to national
                                conditions. These conditions, when expressed in savings per kilometre between
                                conventional and PEVs, vary between €0.03 and €0.08 per km (between countries that
                                combine less electricity prices with high gasoline prices or vice versa). These
                                country specific fuel savings are used to set the growth parameter of a logistic
                                diffusion curve. The second parameter of the diffusion curve, the time with 50% market
                                diffusion, is set such that the logistic market diffusion curve meets the countries
                                2016 PEV sales share. We thus arrive at country specific logistic market diffusion
                                curves of PEV that are projected until 2050.

                            <p>
                                We calculate sales and stock for AFV heavy duty vehicles until 2030 for Germany and
                                extrapolate market shares until 2050. The reason for the extrapolation is that the
                                extrapolation of market shares provides higher certainty than extrapolating the
                                forecasts for individual parameters in long-term forecasts. The calculated market
                                shares are considered equal in all other European countries as we assume a coordinated
                                European infrastructure ramp up and heavy road transport is to a large extent
                                trans-national in Europe. For catenary hybrid trucks, the share of electric driving
                                with trolley trucks depends on the share of highways with overhead lines and the
                                annual driving distance of the truck (the average share of km on the highway increases
                                with annual vehicle km travelled). We assume that connected highway segments with the
                                highest heavy-duty traffic will be electrified first. In many cases, the distribution
                                of highway traffic is right skewed. Accordingly, the relation between the share of
                                electrified vehicle kilometres and electrified highway kilometres is modelled
                                mathematically.

                            <p>
                                The driving profiles of vehicles form a very important foundation for the
                                calculations. A separate database (“REM2030-Fahrprofile”) is used for commercial
                                traffic (fleet users) and the so called “Mobility Panel” for private and company car
                                users (MOP), which also contains information about the driver that can be used to
                                distinguish private users with privately owned vehicles from those with a company car.
                                The driving data only covers Germany, but general driving patterns do not vary much
                                within Europe, only the total distance travelled (in million passenger km or average
                                annual of vehicle kilometres travelled). The influence of the charging infrastructure
                                can also be modelled to a certain extent using the driving profiles, because the
                                driving profiles of the mobility panel contain information about the trips made.
                                As already discussed, no spatially resolved modelling is done. A willingness to pay
                                more is assigned to each individual private driving profile according to the
                                affiliation to one of four groups in the innovation process. Based on a
                                cross-comparison of the different studies, it is assumed that 55% of commercial users
                                are not willing to pay more. The other 45% have a willingness to pay 10% more on the
                                so-called Full Leasing Rate. In the market evolution model, this is translated as an
                                extra 7% on top of the purchase price of the conventional reference model. Overall,
                                the assumptions about the willingness to pay more are rather cautious compared to the
                                statements made in the underlying studies. As already stated, company car users are
                                assumed not willing to pay more. In ALADIN, only 1.5% of the driving profiles are
                                assigned a willingness to pay of more than 10%, and approximately half of the private
                                driving profiles are given a low willingness to pay 1% more. The willingness to pay
                                more is assumed to decrease to 60% by 2020 and further thereafter for both private and
                                commercial users, because novel technologies become less attractive over time.

                                Driving date for medium and heavy-duty vehicles is taken from the large-scale
                                commercial vehicle survey KiD 2010 for Germany. It is enriched with transport
                                performance and annual mileage data from EUROSTAT.

                                Switzerland and Norway). It simulates the market diffusion of AFVs from 2011 until 2050.
                                Focus of the analysis are passenger cars, as well as light-duty, medium-duty and

                                The model covers the PEV, BEV, PHEV, REEV, CNG, and FCEV as mitigation options in road
                                transport for passenger cars. The model can incorporate the change in energy, vehicle,
                                or battery prices directly. Changes in general car usage or purchase, such as the
                                increased usage of car sharing, must be integrated as changes in total passenger car
                                sales. Furthermore, modal shifts can be integrated indirectly too, e.g. as reduction in
                                annual mileage of the vehicles or lower total number of vehicles sold. One strength of
                                the model is that an increased availability of public charging infrastructure can be
                                directly modelled.

                                For medium and heavy-duty vehicles, the ALADIN model covers BEV, PHEV, FCEV, and
                                catenary hybrid trucks as mitigation technologies. An increase in charging or
                                refuelling infrastructure can be directly modelled in ALADIN, whereas a total change in
                                freight activity must be incorporated as reduced vehicles sales or change in annual
                                mileage.

                                            Market diffusion scenarios of electric trucks in Europe are studied,
                                            while covering CO2 emissions from trucks in the transport and energy
                                            sector. We introduce load curves for trolley trucks and run a complete
                                            energy system analysis including trolley trucks. We find that electric
                                            trucks can reduce CO2 emissions from the transport and energy sector
                                            even when no additional renewable capacity is installed.

                                The FORECAST model is designed as a tool that can be used to support strategic decision
                                making. Its main objective is to support scenario design and analysis for the long-term
                                development of energy demand and GHG emissions for the industry, residential and
                                tertiary
                                sectors at country level. FORECAST considers a broad range of mitigation options to
                                reduce CO2 emissions, combined with a high level of technological detail. It is based on
                                a bottom-up modelling approach considering the dynamics of technologies and
                                socioeconomic
                                drivers. Technology diffusion and stock turnover are explicitly considered to allow
                                insights into transition pathways. The model further aims to integrate different energy
                                efficiency and decarbonisation policy options and allows to address research questions
                                related to energy demand including the analysis of scenarios for future demand of
                                individual energy carriers like electricity or natural gas, calculating energy saving
                                potentials and impact on GHG emissions as well as abatement cost curves, ex-ante policy
                                impact assessments and the investigation of long-term sustainable energy transition
                                scenarios (Fleiter et al., 2018 and Herbst et al., 2017).

                                services/tertiary and residential</b>. While all sector modules follow a similar

                                technology structure, heterogeneity of actors and data availability.

                                module. Each sector requires sector specific <b>activity data</b>, like industrial
                                production in the industry sector, number of employees in the services sector
                                and number of households in the residential sector. These can either be retrieved
                                from external sources or derived within the macroeconomic module of FORECAST,
                                based on available GDP and population projections from other models or studies.
                                Furthermore, end-consumer <b>energy prices</b> play an important role in each sector and
                                are distinguished by energy carrier (e.g. electricity, coal, oil, natural gas,
                                biomass and district heating). These too can either be retrieved from external
                                sources or derived within the macroeconomic module of FORECAST based on available
                                wholesale price projections for electricity, coal, oil, and natural gas. The third
                                group of input data, the <b>technology characterisation</b> also reflects data
                                availability of the individual sectors. While in the industry and tertiary sector
                                the model works with so-called energy-efficiency measures (EEMs), which represent
                                all kinds of actions that reduce energy consumption, in the residential sector
                                the stock of alternative appliances and the market share of different efficiency
                                classes is explicitly modelled. In all cases, energy savings can be calculated and
                                traced back to technological dynamics including cost considerations.

                                A list of technologies considered in the model is provided in Table 11, showing its high
                                level of technological detail. FORECAST considers all major tertiary and household
                                appliances and a large variety of different heating technologies for buildings
                                (also by sub-sector). In the industry sector, in addition to the differentiation
                                by sub-sector and energy carrier, the most important energy-intensive products are
                                implemented in the model and further differentiated by production process. Depending
                                on data availability, processes can consist of small individual production steps
                                (e.g. burning of clinker in the cement industry) or entire production lines for
                                individual products or product groups (e.g. bricks, ceramic tiles).

                                Diffusion depends on boundaries and payback time. The payback time in turn is determined
                                by

                                The tertiary model distinguishes eight sub-sectors (trade, hotel and restaurants,
                                traffic and data
                                transmission, finance, health, education, public administration and other) and various
                                end-uses as
                                shown in Table 11. To derive future energy demand, an annual energy service driver is
                                multiplied by
                                the annual specific energy demand per unit of driver. For example, the electricity
                                demand for space
                                cooling can be calculated using the specific energy demand per m² floor area cooled and
                                the quantity
                                of the given driver, here the share of cooled floor area per employee. This is in turn
                                driven by
                                employment in the tertiary subsectors. The diffusion of energy efficiency measures
                                depends on the
                                cost-effectiveness of efficiency alternatives or efficiency add-on measures (see section

                                The residential model separates household energy demand into four sub-groups (appliances
                                and lighting,
                                sanitary hot water, space heating, new and others), which are reflected by various
                                end-uses
                                (see Table 11). The end-uses are further broken down into technologies, and each
                                technology is
                                distinguished by various efficiency classes. The calculation of energy demand in the
                                residential
                                sector is structured as follows: the majority of final residential energy demand is
                                attributed to
                                space heating. The useful heat demand is calculated in a first step based on a detailed
                                representation
                                of the European building stock. The model is designed as a vintage stock model that
                                captures the
                                number of end-uses in the market in combination with their age distribution. For heating
                                systems,
                                the vintage stock is represented by market shares. Technology diffusion depends on the
                                relative cost
                                advantages of substitution alternatives. The cheaper an alternative is, the larger its
                                market share
                                in the corresponding year (for details see Elsland, 2016).

                                The bottom-up approach, which distinguishes individual technologies, allows modelling
                                the diffusion
                                of technologies as the result of individual investment decisions taken over time. For
                                all types of
                                investment decisions, the model follows a simulation approach rather than optimisation
                                in order to
                                better capture the real-life behaviour of companies and households.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whenever possible, the investment decision is modelled as a discrete choice process,
                                where households
                                or companies choose among alternative technologies to satisfy a certain energy service.
                                It is
                                implemented as a logit approach considering the total cost of ownership (TCO) of an
                                investment plus
                                other intangible costs. This approach ensures that even if one technology choice is more
                                cost-effective than others, it will not gain a 100% market share. This effect reflects
                                heterogeneity in the market, niche markets and non-rational behaviour of companies and
                                households,
                                which is a central capability to model policies. Still, the resulting technology
                                development
                                (and energy demand) is price sensitive.

                                The replacement of equipment/buildings/technologies is based on a vintage stock approach
                                allowing to
                                realistically model the replacement of the capital stock considering its age
                                distribution. Some parts
                                of the industrial and the tertiary sector are not using a vintage stock approach, due to
                                the huge
                                heterogeneity of technologies on the one hand and data scarcity on the other. Technology
                                diffusion,
                                however, is modelled based on a similar simulation algorithm taking heterogeneity and
                                non-rational
                                behaviour into account.

                                and the vintage stock approach are well suited to simulate most types of policies.

                                “qualitative character”. The discrete-choice approach, however, allows to consider such

                                factors. For example, labelling of appliances resulting from the EU Labelling Directive

                                modelled by adjusting the logit parameters and thus assuming a less heterogeneous
                                market, in which
                                a higher share of consumers select the appliance with the lowest total cost of
                                ownership. See for

                                            All scenarios show that an ambitious improvement in energy efficiency
                                            can reduce the costs of decarbonisation and make substantial contributions
                                            to CO2 savings over the next 10 to 20 years in particular. However, that
                                            alone is not enough to reduce emissions sufficiently. A decisive factor is
                                            the rapid expansion of renewable energies in order to generate CO2-free
                                            electricity. This is particularly important because electricity consumption
                                            in the industrial sector could rise sharply by 2050 - doubling or even
                                            tripling depending on the scenario. This would happen above all if
                                            electricity were increasingly used for process heat generation and
                                            important processes in the chemical and steel industries were converted to
                                            electrolysis hydrogen. A 95 percent reduction in greenhouse gases and thus
                                            almost CO2-neutral industrial production by 2050 requires fundamental
                                            changes along the value chain. These include the spread of low-CO2 cement
                                            types, efficient use of materials and a comprehensive recycling economy.
                                            The capture and storage of CO2 can also play a role, for example in
                                            reducing remaining emissions during the production of cement clinker and
                                            lime

                                            Decarbonising heating and cooling requires energy efficiency on both
                                            demand and supply sides of the heat sector. Heat savings can
                                            cost-effectively reduce the total heat demand in Europe by
                                            approximately 30-50%. District heating can capture excess heat, which
                                            is currently being wasted, and can replace fossil energy sources to heat
                                            EU cities. Based on cost and energy considerations, district heating
                                            should increase from today’s level of 10% up to 50% by 2050. Large heat
                                            pumps and other proven technologies can provide next generation district

                                LEAP, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System, is a widely-used
                                scenario-based software tool, which supports a wide range of different modelling
                                methodologies for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment
                                at many different scales, ranging from cities and states to national, regional and
                                global applications. On the demand side, these applications range from bottom-up
                                end-use accounting techniques to top-down macroeconomic modelling. LEAP’s
                                functionalities lay within the core activities of countries undertaking integrated
                                resource planning, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation assessments, and Low Emission
                                Development Strategies (LEDS), especially in the developing world. The main purpose
                                of LEAP lies in providing a means of comparison between a “Business as Usual (BaU)”
                                scenario, and other user-customised scenarios promoting the adoption of innovative
                                policies and sustainable strategies in the context of a country, in crucial activity
                                sectors, such as the energy production and the building envelope. LEAP supports
                                numerous scenarios, thus providing for in-depth insights regarding a wide variety
                                of key energy, environmental and socioeconomic indicators. At least 32 countries
                                used LEAP for a variety of tasks focused on the field of GHG mitigation by several
                                techniques, such as changing the energy consumption on the demand side, shifting
                                the energy carrier on the supply side and imposing policies on the supply and demand
                                sides (Martı́nez-Jaramillo et al., 2017) in the context of creating energy and
                                emissions scenarios, to be the basis for their Intended Nationally Determined
                                Contributions (INDCs) to climate action. (Dagher and Ruble, 2011) constructed
                                LEAP-based scenarios and examined the technical, economic, and environmental
                                implications of all scenarios with regard to electrical planning. Using the
                                LEAP model, Jun and Lee (2010) focused on the penetration of renewable energies
                                on the existing electricity generation market in South Korea, in terms of economic
                                and environmental influence. (Cai et al., 2007) assessed the reduction potential of
                                CO2 emissions in China’s electricity sector and simulated different development paths.

                                LEAP is based on an integrated, scenario-based structure, which can also be used to
                                track energy consumption, production and resource extraction in all sectors of an
                                economy, including accounting for GHG emission sources and sinks at both the energy
                                and non-energy sectors. LEAP’s structure enhances the representation of the energy
                                system of each Member State by breaking down the energy used in each economic
                                activity, even to the “lowest” level (i.e. households). It also allows for the
                                modelling of several energy production units (e.g. lignite, natural gas, renewables,
                                etc.) along with their technical specifications (e.g. power, technical minimum,
                                lifetime, fuel, etc.) as well as optimised unit commitment, in terms of meeting the
                                end-user demand curve with the minimum cost. Energy CO2 emissions and other
                                greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2 from others sources, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6)
                                are then calculated by the model, with respect to the energy production side.
                                In addition to tracking GHG emissions, LEAP can also be used to analyse emissions
                                of local and regional air pollutants, and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs),
                                making it well-suited to studies of the climate co-benefits of local air pollution
                                reduction. Given LEAP’s diversity, it can be used to explore GHG mitigation
                                alternatives through energy system transformations as well as to provide policy
                                insights towards transitioning to a climate-resilient energy sector.

                                On the demand side, each sector is modelled as a production or an energy intensity level
                                and the use
                                of other key intermediate factors (capital, intermediate consumptions, etc.) given its
                                expectations
                                on demands and prices. Regarding the end-user side specifically, the final demand is
                                usually broken
                                down into four major categories: a) residential, b) agricultural, c) commercial and d)
                                transport,
                                providing the user with the capacity to introduce all associated information, such as
                                (non-)
                                electrified households, passenger- and ton-km, etc. As we move further from the demand
                                side, LEAP
                                allows the user to model the energy production side, along with their respective
                                networks and
                                implications (e.g. resource limitations and energy losses). This approach can be used to
                                fully
                                describe individual policy measures which can then be combined in different combinations
                                and
                                permutations into alternative integrated scenarios, thus allowing policy makers to
                                assess the impact
                                of an individual policy as well as the interactions that occur when multiple policies
                                and
                                measures are combined, in terms of both energy and environmental impact.

                                LEAP is intended as a medium- to long-term modelling tool. Its calculations occur based
                                on a
                                user-defined time-step (e.g. annual, 5-year period, etc.) and baseline year (e.g. 2005,
                                2010, etc.),
                                and the time horizon can extend to an unlimited number of years (beyond 2100). Studies
                                typically
                                include both a historical period known as the Current Accounts, in which the model is
                                run to test
                                its ability to replicate known statistical data, as well as multiple forward-looking
                                scenarios.
                                Typically, most studies use a forecast period of between 20 and 50 years.

                                Some results are calculated with a finer level of temporal detail. For example, the year
                                can
                                be split into different user-defined “time slices” to represent seasons, types of days
                                or even
                                representative times of the day. These slices can be used to examine how loads vary
                                within the
                                year and how electric power plants are dispatched differently in different seasons. LEAP
                                includes an
                                easily-customised dataset of time-slices, which extends from seasonal segregation (i.e.
                                summer,
                                winter, autumn, fall) today- and night- time of all seasons as well as hourly
                                representation.
                                This kind of in-depth time-slicing seeks to provide analytical insights and partially
                                offset
                                the stochastic nature of the energy production sector (given the high RES penetration)
                                and the
                                fluctuating end-user demand across the year, by facilitating the matching of supply and
                                demand in
                                each time-slice.

                                The climate component in LEAP includes a diverse database of both energy and
                                non-energy sector GHG emissions per fuel or activity, thus calculating the
                                final GHG emissions stemming from an energy system’s operation at global,
                                national, regional, or local level, based on the initial energy and
                                socioeconomic data provided (e.g. demographics, income, GDP, etc.).
                                The tool tracks far beyond the three main sources of greenhouse gases
                                (i.e. CO2, CH4, and N2O), extending its analysis to tracking SLCFs such as
                                fluorinated gases, black carbon, etc. The LEAP model also includes the
                                Technology and Environmental Database (TED), which provides extensive
                                information describing the technical characteristics, costs and environmental
                                impacts of a wide range of energy technologies (including existing technologies,
                                current best practices and next generation devices), compiled from numerous
                                sources (e.g. Eurostat, EEA, etc.). Thus, LEAP is appropriate for energy policy
                                analysis and climate change mitigation assessment. Since LEAP is a scenario-based
                                modelling tool, its climate module calculates changes in the atmospheric
                                concentration of all implicated GHG emissions between a reference scenario (which
                                depicts the current condition of a system in terms of energy—demand and supply—and
                                demographics—population, income, etc.) and a number of GHG mitigation-oriented
                                scenarios based on current and future limitations, aligned with the ongoing global
                                treaties and agreements (such as the goals set by the Paris Agreement or by
                                increasing ambition).

                                (e.g. population, household size, etc.) and energy sector (e.g. supply and demand),
                                as well as demand for other goods and services that affect GHG emissions
                                (such as agricultural demand) for both the reference and the mitigation scenarios,
                                over the time horizon of the analysis. It should be noted that LEAP does not
                                include a default set of socioeconomic and energy data, since it is an
                                easily-customised tool that can be adjusted to use several socioeconomic
                                and sectoral growth projections from different sources (aside from SSPs). Since
                                the economic, population and sectoral growths are used to capture specific drivers
                                for the changes in energy demand in a reference scenario (in which no climate
                                change mitigation measure has been applied), LEAP allows users to self-assess and
                                define the sets of energy service demands over the horizon, as well as to
                                quantify them based on a diverse set of quantification units. This set of
                                quantification varies from passenger-kms and tonne-kms in the transport sector
                                to kWhs and metric tonnes in the industrial sector, as well as to Gigajoules of
                                final consumption per unit of activity level (GJ/€). LEAP is
                                also widely open to conducting cost-benefit analyses if the required socioeconomic
                                and energy inputs needed are partially available.

                                LEAP is calibrated for the initial period, in terms of fuels, based on a
                                standard fuels database drawing data from IEA, UN and other standard international
                                sources (such as the IPCC). These data sources should suffice for most LEAP analyses.
                                However, LEAP allows the user to edit the default data, for example to change the
                                energy contents of certain fuels (such as coal and wood) to reflect the conditions
                                in the area they aim to study. In addition, LEAP provides an “Add” and “Delete”
                                button for the user to add a new fuel and delete one respectively, if necessary,
                                and manually define its respective specifications. Regarding the projections for
                                energy in the reference and mitigation scenarios, the installed technological
                                capacity along with its CAPEX and OPEX, the exported, imported, produced and
                                consumed quantities for all energy carriers etc., LEAP does not include a
                                respective database, and therefore this kind of data must be entered and updated
                                manually.

                                LEAP includes a wide dataset of the most major fossil fuel and low-carbon
                                technologies that are perceived to be commonly exploited in the upcoming years.
                                Thus, for each economic activity, the energy demand is broken down in key
                                categories such as oil, gas, solid fuel, biomass, etc. Regarding the electricity
                                sector, LEAP allows for an in-depth representation of the energy mix capability
                                by providing several energy-based production units such as, solar, nuclear, wind,
                                etc. By simulating the substitution of low-carbon for high-carbon technologies
                                in response to their relative costs, as well as emissions constraints, the LEAP
                                model simulates mitigation. The principal energy sector CO2 mitigation technology
                                options are as shown in Table 14. The plethora of energy choices that LEAP provides
                                can be crucial for the suggestion of several mitigation/adaptation policies.
                                These scenarios may aim to the reduction of GHG emissions or the abatement of
                                the cost of energy production. An interesting example is the choice between
                                hydroelectric power and nuclear power. Both energy sources are emission-free
                                but each of them features different costs depending on the region they are applied.

                                LEAP simultaneously calculates the quantity of the energy produced, converted and
                                consumed with regard to the different “commodities” accounted for in the model,
                                the total GHG emissions stemming from a system’s operation, as well as the way in
                                which these emissions are broken down into each sector, in a given region or economy
                                under a range of alternative assumptions on population, economic development,
                                technology, prices and so on. These commodities comprise the different energy forms,
                                the deployed technologies, and the energy services. LEAP allows to reach a
                                cost-minimising level of commodity production and consumption, consistent
                                with meeting all current and future energy demands and emissions constraints.
                                The total energy system cost is calculated as a Net Present Value (NPV) cost of
                                the energy system over the entire pre-defined time horizon. With its flexible data
                                structures, LEAP allows for analysis as rich—in technological specification and
                                end-use detail—as the user chooses. All of the aforementioned features contribute
                                to the creation and evaluation of multiple alternative mitigation scenarios.
                                These scenarios can be compared with a reference scenario (which projects the
                                progress of energy demand, energy production, social costs and GHGs emissions of
                                the region studied if no significant changes occur on the current energy system),
                                in order to evaluate the contingent reduction of GHG emissions or social costs
                                of the different mitigation scenarios suggested.

                                LEAP can be used to project the energy supply and demand situation in order to get
                                a glimpse of future patterns, identify potential problems, and assess the likely
                                impacts of energy policies. In this respect, LEAP allows to examine a wide variety

                                LEAP does not automatically calculate the implications on non-climate SDGs of its
                                least-cost energy system to
                                meet prescribed climate or emissions constraints. However, it is possible to exploit
                                LEAP’s outputs
                                and conduct “off-model” calculations to estimate many of the SDG implications. For
                                example, LEAP
                                reports the total final energy consumption in an energy system. This energy can be
                                reshaped at lower/higher
                                levels, depending on the successful implementation of different mitigation scenarios,
                                thus allowing
                                for an estimation of the energy-poor citizens.

                                            An interesting conclusion of this study is the fact that if the

                                            there will be a higher demand for coal and other fossil fuels, which
                                            will result in the increase of greenhouse gases emissions.

                                TIMES is a modelling platform for local, national or multi-regional energy systems,
                                which provides a technology-rich basis for estimating how energy system operations
                                will evolve over a long term, multiple period time horizon (Loulou and Labriet, 2008)
                                These energy system operations include the extraction of primary energy such as
                                fossil fuels, the conversion of this primary energy into useful forms (such as
                                electricity, hydrogen, solid heating fuels and liquid transport fuels), and the
                                use of these fuels in a range of energy service applications (vehicular transport,
                                building heating and cooling, and the powering of industrial manufacturing plants).
                                In multi-region versions of the model, the trade of fuels between regions is also
                                estimated. The TIMES framework is usually applied to the analysis of the entire
                                energy sector, but it may also be applied to the detailed study of single sectors
                                (e.g. the electricity and district heat sector).

                                The EU-TIMES model, is the multi-region, European version of TIMES,
                                which is designed for analysing the role of energy technologies and their
                                innovation needs for meeting European policy targets related to energy and
                                climate change. It models technologies uptake and deployment and their
                                interaction with the energy infrastructure in an energy systems perspective.
                                It is a relevant tool to support impact assessment studies in the energy policy
                                field that require quantitative modelling at an energy system level with a high
                                technology detail. The EU-TIMES model represents the EU Member States and
                                neighbouring countries, where each country is modelled as one region; producing
                                projections (or scenarios) of the EU energy system showing its evolution up to
                                2060 under different sets of specific technology and policy assumptions and
                                constraints.

                                The EU-TIMES model considers both the supply and demand sides and includes the
                                following seven sectors: primary energy supply (including transformation);
                                electricity generation; industry; residential; commercial; agriculture; and transport.

                            </p>

                                The most relevant model outputs are the annual stock and activity of energy
                                supply and demand technologies for each region and period. This is accompanied
                                by associated energy and material flows including emissions to air and fuel
                                consumption, detailed for each energy carrier. Besides technical outputs, the
                                associated operation and maintenance costs, the investment costs for new
                                technologies, all energy and materials commodities prices
                                (including for emissions if an emission cap is considered),
                                are obtained for every time step.

                                According to its analytical paradigm, EU-TIMES models energy dynamics over a
                                multi period time horizon. The time horizon over which the model simulates the
                                evolution of the energy system is divided into a user-chosen number of time-periods;
                                which can vary depending on a number of factors, such as the scope of the analysis,
                                model setup, computational limitations, etc.

                                For all quantities such as installed technology levels,
                                power plant capacities and energy and emissions flows,
                                any annual input quantity (e.g. coal used in a power plant per year) or
                                output quantity (e.g. electricity generated from the coal plant per year)
                                related to a given time period applies identically to each of the years in that
                                period.

                            <p>
                                In addition to the multi-year time periods described above, in the JET
                                there are time divisions within a year, called “time slices”, which may be
                                deﬁned by the user, so as to capture different weather conditions, consumer
                                behaviours, and energy demand conditions at different times of the year.
                                There are currently twelve time-slices representing an average of day, night
                                and peak demand for every one of the four seasons of the year (e.g. summer day,
                                summer night and summer peak, etc.).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Time-slices are especially important whenever the mode and cost of production of an
                                energy carrier at different times of the year are signiﬁcantly different
                                (Loulou and Labriet, 2008). This is the case for instance when the demand
                                for an electricity ﬂuctuates across the year and a variety of technologies may
                                be chosen for its production at given times of the year (such as wind power when
                                wind resources are high, and solar photovoltaics when there is a high availability
                                of solar radiation. In such cases, the matching of supply and demand requires that
                                the activities of the technologies producing and consuming the electricity be
                                tracked – and matched – in each time slice.

                                carbon dioxide (CO2) from both combustion and industrial processing.
                                A special module of the JET can be enabled to allow emissions trading across

                                The EU-TIMES model requires inputs concerning the degree to which energy
                                demands, as well as demand for goods and services that result in GHG emissions,
                                will grow over the course of the next decades in the different countries.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Key drivers to the EU-TIMES model are the socioeconomic projections of GDP
                                growth; private consumption as a proxy for disposable income; price evolution
                                and sector production growth, population and number of households etc.; for each
                                country in the model. These drivers are transformed into the different final
                                annual end-use demand projections, which are the key quantities that the
                                EU-TIMES model must produce an energy system to satisfy.
                                The building-related sectors (namely residential and commercial sectors) require
                                a more detailed approach, as to generate the demands for heat, cooling and
                                hot water, characteristics of dwellings are explicitly represented
                                (Chiodi et al., 2017).

                                Across the years several sources and methodologies have been employed to
                                generate updated EU-TIMES energy services demands. For example in
                                Simoes et al. (2017), the materials and energy demand projections for each
                                country are differentiated by economic sector and end-use energy service,
                                using as a starting point historical 2005 data and macroeconomic projections
                                from the GEM-E3 model (Russ et al., 2009) as detailed in (Simoes et al., 2013),
                                and in line with the values considered in the EU Energy Roadmap 2050 reference
                                scenario (EC, 2011). These projections have been further updated to align with
                                latest socioeconomic projections in use within the European Commission
                                (Nijs et al., 2019; Nijs et al., 2017).

                                In total, the EU-TIMES represents about 60 different types of energy services
                                for the transport, residential, agricultural, commercial, industry and non-energy
                                sectors. Some examples include number of residential and commercial dwelling
                                stocks (thousands of dwellings), public street lighting
                                (thousands of lighting points), industry iron & steel (millions of tonnes),
                                transport car distance (billions of passenger kilometres) and transport road
                                freight (billions of tonne kilometres).

                                The socioeconomic, population and physical drivers
                                (e.g. physical production of industrial activities,
                                expected numbers of new dwellings) are used as
                                specific drivers for the growth in energy demands,
                                associated when relevant to demand elasticities,
                                see Loulou et al. (2016) for more details.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the drivers for the different energy demands represented
                                by EU-TIMES model are selected, allocated and quantified,
                                the construction of the reference demand scenario requires computing a set of
                                energy service demands over the horizon.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore EU-TIMES has the capability of
                                estimating the price-based response of these energy service demands to the
                                changing conditions of scenarios in which mitigation occurs. For example,
                                if the cost of energy increases as fossil fuels are replaced by renewables,
                                then the demand for energy services would decrease. To do this,
                                EU-TIMES makes use of another set of inputs, namely own price elasticities,
                                applied to each model energy service. This option can be easily disabled,
                                assuming in that case energy service demands to be inelastic.

                                EU-TIMES is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and
                                low-carbon technologies that are envisaged to be available (for those systems)
                                for at least the first half of the 21st century. By simulating the substitution
                                of low-carbon for high-carbon technologies in response to their relative costs,
                                as well as emissions constraints and/or carbon prices, the model simulates
                                mitigation. The typical question that EU-TIMES can address is what
                                technologies are competitive under various policy scenarios.
                                For emerging technologies with a small uptake, EU-TIMES can
                                estimate what technology improvements would be needed to make
                                these competitive (Nijs et al., 2018).

                                The principal energy sector mitigation options are shown in Table 16,

                                water availability, changes in building envelope requirements,
                                or increased requirements for specific energy services.

                            <p>
                                According to its analytical paradigm, the EU-TIMES model computes a dynamic
                                inter-temporal partial equilibrium for the (multi-) regional energy and
                                emission markets, based on the maximisation of total surplus defined as the
                                sum of surplus of the suppliers and consumers. In other words, it is assumed
                                that the multi-regional system evolves, while maintaining intra and
                                inter-temporal partial economic equilibrium, and always occupies the
                                technical possibility frontier. The process of solving the model determines
                                the optimal mix of technologies (capacity and activity) and fuels at each period,
                                the associated emissions, the mining and “trading activities”, the quantity and
                                prices of all commodities, all in time series from the base year to the
                                time horizon of the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most relevant model outputs are the annual stock and activity of energy supply
                                and demand technologies for each region and period. This is accompanied by
                                associated energy and material flows including emissions to air and fuel
                                consumption, detailed for each energy carrier. Besides technical outputs,
                                the associated operation and maintenance costs, the investment costs for
                                new technologies, all energy and materials commodities prices (including
                                for emissions if an emission cap is considered), are obtained for every time step.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                EU-TIMES combines a social approach towards the time value of money and
                                a private approach towards risk as well as the cost of financing based on
                                the individual technologies. The EU-TIMES model uses a mix of private
                                and social discount rates, since for the evaluation of investment decisions
                                private discount rates are used, but for the timing of investment a social
                                discount rate is applied. The first determines whether an investment pays
                                off with the assumed private discount rate. The higher the (perceived) risk is,
                                the higher the discount rate. Technologically specific discount rates are used
                                to balance planning approaches and include risks for specific technologies.
                                The second determines when is the best timing to do investments reflecting
                                the time preference for consuming as well as a decreasing marginal utility of
                                future consumption. This discount rate is applied primarily to make intertemporal
                                decisions based on Net Present Value (Nijs et al., 2019).

                                The EU-TIMES model is “by paradigm” a technology rich tool where techno-economic
                                information is assigned to each process (existing and future) of the system,
                                and therefore many datasets/parameters can be extracted and reported.

                                In line with this concept EU-TIMES monitors cost evolution of a large subset of
                                technologies from the upstream (e.g. costs of primary resources), transformation
                                (e.g. electricity and hydrogen production), and final consumption (e.g. end-use
                                sectors technologies; as appliances, cars, etc.).

                                As for all TIMES-based models, EU-TIMES can consider policies that affect
                                either the entire energy system, sectors, group of technologies/commodities,
                                or single technologies/commodities. For example, the following policies can be
                                implemented:
                            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                                <li>Carbon emissions constraint or a carbon price (imposed as a tax) in each region
                                    that it represents, or alternatively all regions simultaneously.
                                </li>
                                <li>Subsidies/capital grants on specific sets technologies (e.g. on solar PV).</li>
                                <li>Constraints on the availability of particular technologies (e.g. “no nuclear”,
                                    variable renewables accounting for no more than 50% of electricity generation).
                                </li>
                                <li>Constraints on the growth rates of particular technologies (e.g. carbon capture
                                    and storage power generation capacity cannot grow at more than 20% per year).
                                </li>
                                <li>Inter-regional emissions trading (such as the EU Emissions Trading System
                                    - EU ETS).
                                </li>
                                <li>Technology standards (e.g. efficiency labelling or ban of specific technologies).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For EU-TIMES the most commonly applied policies include:
                            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                                <li>Feed-in Tariffs and green certificates on renewable technologies.</li>
                                <li>Renewable targets in gross final energy consumption (e.g. in line with
                                    EU Renewable Energy Directive RED).
                                </li>
                                <li>Emission targets (e.g. the EU Effort Sharing Regulation - ESR).</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, the structure of the EU-TIMES may allow (although some modelling
                                expansion is required <sup>16</sup>) the exploration of energy security concepts,
                                with the possible analysis of scenario variants and policies related to
                                criticalities across sensitive corridor hubs (i.e. EU REACCESS project<sup>17</sup>),
                                \and security of supply (Chiodi et al., 2016).

                                            CCS and nuclear), and ii) a pro renewables world, where decarbonisation
                                            is mainly driven by renewable resources.

                                            are in any case deployed rapidly across the modelled time horizon
                                            (as PV) as this could significantly reduce the energy system costs,

                                            technologies, R&D efforts could be mainly directed to increase

                                            efforts should be assigned to improving their techno-economic

                                The NEMESIS model (New Econometric Model of Evaluation by
                                Sectoral Interdependency and Supply) is a sectoral detailed
                                macroeconomic model for the European Union (Boitier et al.
                                2018). It is a system of economic models for every European
                                country (including the United Kingdom), devoted to study issues
                                that link economic development, competitiveness, employment and
                                public accounts to economic policies, and notably all
                                structural policies involving long term effects.
                                The essential purpose of the model is to provide a
                                consolidated framework to realise “Business As Usual"
                                (BAU) scenarios (or other alternative scenarios),
                                up to 30 to 40 years, and to assess the socioeconomic
                                impact of the implementation of all additional
                                policies not already implemented in the BAU.
                                The main mechanisms of the model are based on the behaviour of
                                representative agents: firms, households,
                                government and rest of the world. From the supply side,
                                the model distinguishes 30 different economic activities
                                that produce goods and services through production
                                functions and, to do so, use production factors: capital,
                                energy, low and high-qualified labour and other intermediate consumption.
                                All these economic activities are interrelated by
                                inter-sectoral exchanges (conversion matrices)
                                and external trades with other EU countries and the rest of the world.
                                NEMESIS includes a detailed energy-environment
                                module that allow the model to deal with climate mitigation policies,
                                at EU and EU-national level. This module enhances the representation
                                of the energy-system of each Member
                                State by detailing the energy used
                                (ten different products) by each economic activity but also by households.
                                It also details the power generation sector
                                by allocating electricity production
                                between different technologies through diffusion curves.
                                CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion (FFC) are then calculated from fossil
                                fuel consumption whereas other GHGs
                                (CO2 from others sources, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6) are either calculated by
                                the model (however more roughly than CO2 from fossil fuel combustion) or
                                calibrated on external studies. Furthermore, the model can be relatively easily
                                linked to other tools. In case of a linkage with more detailed energy-system models,
                                NEMESIS is then used to assess the socioeconomic impacts at EU and EU-national level,
                                with detailed characterisation of the energy-system being delegate to the detailed
                                energy models.

                                The NEMESIS model is designed to deliver outputs in annual step.
                                NEMESIS with its level of detail requires a big consolidated
                                database for its functioning. Data are compiled from numerous
                                sources (Eurostat, 2018; WIOD - Timmer et al., 2015; EEA, 2019;
                                etc.) and are post-processed for ensuring their whole accounting coherency.
                                Thus, the dataset used by the model are frequently updated.
                                Currently the model is calibrated for the year 2014, but for some data, historical
                                value goes up 2017, such as for energy consumption and GHG emissions and the model
                                can deliver output up to 2050.

                            <p>
                                On the supply side, each sector is modelled as a representative firm determining its
                                production level and the use of production factors (Capital, low- and high-qualified
                                labour, energy and other intermediate consumptions) given its expectations on demands
                                and prices. Nested CES production functions are used to characterise the production
                                technology with substitution elasticity coming from econometric works or from
                                literature (see Figure 11, see below). Price setting is defined under
                                monopolistic competition, with constant margin rates, different among
                                sectors and inter-sectoral exchanges are captured by conversion matrices that
                                allocate the intermediate consumption (input-output matrices) and investment
                                demands to economic activities producing the required goods and services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Regarding households, final consumption is calculated as follows: (i) firstly,
                                the aggregate consumption is computed based on the real disposable income;
                                (ii) then, the aggregate consumption is allocated among 27 consumption purposes
                                of durable and non-durable goods. The income that is not consumed results in
                                savings, which are split between investment in real estate and financial or
                                monetary assets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The labour market is modelled on the basis of the demand for labour, depending
                                on the optimisation of production levels done by firms, and its supply, which
                                is based on population’s age and qualification levels (approximated using
                                education levels). Wages are determined by augmented Philipps curves<sup>19/sup>, and
                                they are calculated separately for high- and low-qualified workers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for international trade, each EU country exports to (and imports from)
                                two groups of trade partners: intra-EU and extra-EU countries. The determinants
                                of trade are the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods and services,
                                capturing the competitiveness effect, and the volume of exchanges, which is
                                approximated by sectoral demand for goods and services. Different prices are
                                set for intra-EU and extra-EU exports (and imports), to account for the
                                differences in trade costs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Regarding public finances, the model incorporates both subsidies and the main
                                forms of taxation, such as taxes on production and imports, including most
                                notably VAT, taxes on incomes and wealth, social contributions, and taxes on
                                capital. VAT rates are modelled on the basis of the actual VAT rates
                                (as published by European Union, DG TAXUD, 2019). Carbon price can also be
                                introduced in the model and different recycling options can be assessed.
                                Finally, public finance is relatively detailed allowing the model to

                                Besides economic core, the model includes a detailed energy-environment module. For
                                each economic activity, the energy demand (E in Figure 11) is split,
                                thanks to a nested CES function, in ten different energy sources (electricity,
                                oil, gas, solid fuel, biomass including wood, biogas, biofuel and other biomass,
                                geothermal and industrial and urban wastes). Furthermore, the “electricity”
                                sector is not modelled as other sectors, there exists a specific modelling
                                for power generation in order to properly represent energy mix capability in
                                power generation. For this purpose, fourteen different power generation
                                technologies are distinguished, namely: nuclear, hydro, gas, oil,
                                solid fuel, wind (onshore and offshore), geothermal, solar
                                (large scale PV), industrial waste and biomass and waste.
                                Nuclear and hydroelectric power generation technologies are set exogenous because,
                                this setting is assumed to reflect more energy policy choices of each EU member
                                state than only pure economic choices. Other production sources are endogenous
                                and are modelled through diffusion curves (logistic function).

                                emissions, either exogenous values coming from external studies are
                                assumed or a basic modelling with emissions coefficient indexed on

                                As the geographical coverage of the model is limited to the EU, the
                                model does not include emissions impacts on climate such as radiative
                                forcing. The model can only implement climate change mitigation policies on

                                The socioeconomic dimension is essential in the NEMESIS, as on the one hand, it
                                serves as drivers (exogenous variables) of the modelling simulations and on the
                                other hand large a part of the model outputs concern socioeconomic variables.
                                European demographics, particularly working age population, the economic context
                                outside the EU (including GDP growth), exogenous financial variables and labour
                                hypotheses<sup>21</sup> are the main drivers of the model whereas EU GDP growth is an
                                output
                                of the model. Nevertheless, in several multi-model analyses of climate change
                                mitigation options, the socioeconomic characterisation of scenarios already
                                includes GDP projections as in the case for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways or
                                SSP, (Riahi et al., 2017) including three sets of GDP projections (Cuaresma, 2017;
                                Dellink et al., 2017 and Leimbach et al., 2017). Thus, when such socioeconomic
                                characterisation exists the model can be constrained in order to replicate, as
                                close as possible, the EU GDP projections.

                                The first set of inputs required by NEMESIS is related to European demographics.
                                This is essential to define the labour force and then the state of the labour
                                market, and, to a lesser extent, its influence on the households’ final
                                consumption. For NEMESIS, the demographic data include population by age
                                groups and by qualification for each EU country. The age groups that are
                                distinguished are: [0-14], [15-24], [25-54], [55-64], [65-74] and [75-max].
                                Furthermore, demographic data for NEMESIS required the level of qualification,
                                it is measured from two different levels of educational attainment:

                            <p>
                                Historical data come from Eurostat (2017) while, usually,
                                population projections by age group come from Eurostat (2018b); however
                                alternative population projections (with short-term adjustments to ensure
                                consistency between historical data and projections) can be used, including
                                the SSPs (KC and Lutz, 2017) that feature projections by qualification levels
                                (educational level attainment).

                                In NEMESIS, the capital market is not modelled and the interest and exchange rates
                                are both exogenous. It is therefore necessary to describe the financial context in
                                which the EU economies are expected to operate in future years. These assumptions
                                can be modified for scenarios including specific evolutions on interest or exchange
                                rates. In the model, while all variables are defined in euros, the exchange rates are
                                defined (i) between the euro and the Rest of the World currencies and (ii) between
                                the euro and the currencies of the EU countries that do not belong to the Eurozone.
                                These assumptions are based on external studies, mainly focusing on the €/$ exchange
                                rate. For interest rates, that are relevant mainly for the user cost of capital and
                                agents' accounts, projections are also based on external studies or on specific
                                assumptions related to the scenario definition.

                                The Rest of the World (non-EU countries) regions are not directly modelled in
                                NEMESIS and it is necessary to make assumptions on the evolution of global
                                demand for the different products and on global prices of the different
                                commodities that are traded by EU countries. Generally, the exogenous variables
                                representing the demands for the EU coming from the rest of the World are
                                calculated from the WIOD2016 dataset (Timmer et al., 2015). The methodology
                                uses the World Input-Output Table (WIOT), which retraces the inter-industrial
                                exchanges between sectors, with also the geographical origin of the products
                                used. The combination of these matrices with assumptions on the growth of GDP
                                in the different countries outside EU allows to calculate vectors of addressed
                                demands per country and per sector. The expected growth of GDP for non-EU countries
                                are exogenously defined and based on external studies, SSP scenario could be used
                                here or alternatively, GDP for non-EU countries and even sectoral value added if
                                available could come from other models, as a part of an operational linkage between
                                a global macroeconomic model and NEMESIS.

                                The second set of exogenous variables correspond to the price of the imported goods
                                and services from the rest of the World defined for each country and sector. These
                                are defined exogenously on the basis of past trends or on external studies when
                                available.

                                economy is related to the prices of raw materials and notably of fossil fuels
                                (oil, gas and coal). Here again, fossil fuel prices could be an element of
                                linkage between a global IAM, in which fossil fuels market are modelled, and
                                the NEMESIS model.

                                Usually, there exists two different possibilities for the NEMESIS model to deal
                                with climate change mitigation actions either using the model including the
                                energy and environment module or using NEMESIS linked with other modelling tools,
                                typically more detailed and accurate to assess these actions, especially
                                energy-system models. In the first case, climate change mitigation essentially
                                corresponds to complying with a pre-defined annual GHG emissions binding target
                                through the implementation of economic instruments in the model, such as carbon
                                prices. In the second case, climate change mitigation policies are implemented
                                (at least partially, when the linkage concerns only specific sectoral tools) in
                                the soft-linked tool(s). This inter-linkage aims at expressing climate change
                                mitigation costs as calculated by the coupled tool(s) in the NEMESIS model and it
                                requires significant work to ensure consistency between variables exchanged
                                among all tools, including in particular a proper interpretation of the meaning
                                of these variables. Some of past studies of both settings are included in Table 23.

                                Finally, and more particularly when NEMESIS is used as a standalone model, i.e.
                                without linking it with other modelling tools, the implementation of climate change
                                mitigation options requires the definition of assumptions on the policy design, on
                                the economic instruments implemented and on what is happening in the rest of the world.
                            </p>

                                The model can deal with different economic instruments for the implementation of
                                climate change mitigation in the EU: “universal” carbon prices, sectoral and/or
                                nationally differentiated carbon prices, support to “green” technologies, permit
                                allocation with different allocation rules, etc. According to the economic
                                instruments implemented, it is also necessary to define the recycling scheme
                                of the potential revenues produced by a new taxation (or the origin of the
                                resources in the case of public financial supports), such as reduction of other
                                taxes or financial compensation to economic agents, etc. All these aspects must
                                be defined in the design of the scenario, because they will impact the outputs of
                                the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beside internal EU policy, it is also important to define what is happening in the
                                rest of the world. Indeed, the characterisation of the socioeconomic impacts of
                                mitigation options implemented in the rest of the world is required either on
                                the basis of exogenous assumptions or drawing from results of interlinked global
                                modelling tools, as it affects the output of the NEMESIS model, as presented in
                                Section 3.5.4.3. For instance, a unilateral implementation of a stringent climate
                                change mitigation policy in EU can have negative impacts on the competitiveness of
                                EU firms and can even lead to new design of policy options in the EU, such as carbon
                                border tax or free permit allowance in the EU emissions trading system (ETS).

                                            Among other analyses, a multi-model analysis has been achieved using
                                            two different kind of models: macroeconomic models and energy-system
                                            models. Finally, the report recommends, for 2030, to put forward a
                                            shadow price of €250 per ton of CO2e. By 2050 it is expected to align
                                            with the estimated costs of the enabling technologies required for
                                            decarbonisation —therefore a cautious range of €600 to €900/ton of CO2e.

                                            provide a “triple dividend”, at which ambition levels of 2030 RES
                                            targets, and what the role of the support policy scheme for electricity
                                            is. It applies two types of models: a detailed techno-economic
                                            sectoral model of the deployment of RES and two macroeconomic models.
                                            Our findings suggest that up to 2030 our triple-dividend hypothesis
                                            holds even under a declining role of Europe as a technology provider
                                            for the rest of the world. More ambiguous is the order of magnitude
                                            of the effects on GDP and employment, which differs noticeably
                                            depending on the economic theory applied in the different models.
                                            Nevertheless, both models predict slightly higher GDP and employment
                                            in 2030 when implementing ambitious RES targets.

                                            The report provides a quantified scenario of Energy-Air-Climate for
                                            France up to 2035. The quantification has been done with the support of
                                            different modelling tools (sectoral energy system, global energy-system,
                                            macroeconomic model). Three scenarios have been quantified: a
                                            reference scenario including existing policy instruments; a more
                                            ambitious scenario, as regards of GHG emissions mitigation
                                            including additional policy measures; and a very ambitious
                                            scenario with reinforced GHG mitigation policies.
                                            These are used as benchmark scenarios for the
                                            French climate policies. Here, the NEMESIS model
                                            has assessed the socioeconomic impact of the two ambitious scenarios in
                                            terms of GDP, employment and detailed economic activity.

                                            This paper explores in a systematic manner the required energy system
                                            transformation and the associated costs incurred for the EU in order
                                            to meet the decarbonisation targets as specified in the EU Roadmap
                                            2050, i.e. the 80% GHG emissions reduction target and the equivalent
                                            carbon budget by 2050. Seven large-scale energy-economy models, are
                                            employed for the simulation and quantification of alternative EU
                                            decarbonisation pathways under technological limitations and
                                            climate policy delays. The models’ results show that the EU
                                            emissions reduction target is feasible with currently known
                                            technological options at low costs (lower than 1% of GDP in
                                            the period 2015–2050).

                                CONTO is a system of interconnected macro-structural calculations at the national
                                level, which allows it to describe the synchronised development of economy and the
                                energy sector of the Russian Federation, as well as the level of associated CO2
                                emissions. The economic unit is represented by input-output tables, which describe
                                the inter-industry goods flows during production and consumption processes. The
                                energy sector is described in detail in the form of energy balances corresponding
                                to the methodology of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The modelling approach
                                is elaborated in such a way that indicators of socioeconomic development affect the
                                volume and efficiency of energy consumption in the country, which, in turn, determine
                                the economic dynamics of industries involved in the technological chain of energy
                                supply. CONTO also includes the optimisation unit for evaluating the effective fuel
                                structure in the transportation and power sectors based on the cost characteristics
                                of competing technologies. CO2 emissions are calculated in connection with economic
                                input-output tables. This logical framework is well suited to simulating emissions
                                mitigation by both economically and through regulations stimulating energy efficiency
                                and structural change in the fuel mix. Estimation of the macroeconomic impacts of the
                                application of climate-related measures is a substantial component of the modelling
                                process. CONTO is designed specifically for this task formulation, although it is
                                rather flexible for a wide range of research issues for the economy-energy-emissions
                                triangle and can be expanded during the implementation of the PARIS REINFORCE project
                                to take into account potentially appropriate emission mitigation practices.

                                The statistical base of the CONTO model is a series of input-output (I/O)
                                tables for Russia at current and constant prices for 1980–2015, which are
                                consistent with the official data of the Russian Federal State Statistics
                                Service (Rosstat), including the System of National Accounts (SNA). There are
                                44 economic activities in the I/O tables of CONTO shown in Table 3.1.

                                The Russian energy sector is described in the form of energy balances
                                corresponding to the methodology of IEA. The energy balance primary
                                includes coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, biofuels,
                                and other renewables; and secondary energy resources.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The list of supply and demand categories within energy balance is similar to
                                IEA’s methodology with slight simplifications, which are performed in order
                                to synchronise the nomenclature of energy and economy units of CONTO.

                                and stock changes.

                                the most cost-effective structure for satisfying the final
                                demand on electricity/heat and transportation.
                                This unit is filled with the technologies for the production of primary and
                                secondary commodities (mining & extractions processes, power plants, etc.)
                                with cost characteristics. Technologies for the production of
                                hydrogen and its use in transport are also put into the optimisation
                                block, although they are not currently used in Russia.

                                electricity and heat production, and automobile transport.
                                Considerable attention is paid to improving the efficiency
                                of energy consumption through the modernisation of production
                                capacities. By simulating the substitution of low-carbon for high-carbon
                                technologies in response to their relative costs, as well as emissions
                                constraints and/or carbon prices, the CONTO model simulates mitigation.

                                by sectors are calculated. Then, the model calculates the value added (VA) as a

                                redistributed into the household consumption, investments and government
                                consumption. Import is a closing element in meeting demand in case of

                            <p>
                                This section describes the energy calculation algorithm in the CONTO model.
                                It notes the interaction of input-output tables and final energy consumption.
                                It is implemented as follows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Energy consumption in an industry should simultaneously reflect two factors:
                                the gross indicator of the industry and energy efficiency.
                                An industry output can be used as a gross indicator,
                                and energy efficiency is primarily improved through
                                the modernisation of production facilities—that is,
                                through the investment process. In addition, capacity utilisation has an impact.
                                This is important because, firstly, there are economies of scale, and secondly,
                                companies incur conditionally fixed costs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, final energy consumption (FC) is calculated as multiplication of output (X) by
                                specific energy consumption per output unit (EFF), and the latter is the regression
                                function of investment (INV) and capacity utilisation (UTILISATION) in each industry:

                            <p>

                                <i>
                                    FC = X * EFF = X * Function (INV, UTILISATION)
                                </i>
                            </center>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The direct costs matrix (A) is in fact a description of the technological structure
                                of the economy. Therefore, its components’ (I/O coefficients) dynamics should reflect
                                energy efficiency processes. The CONTO model implements an inverse relationship
                                between energy balance and I/O tables, within which particular I/O coefficients
                                (a) regressively depend on EFF:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <center>
                                <i>
                                    a = Function (EFF)
                                </i>
                            </center>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, as a result of investments, production capacities of the ferrous
                                metal industry in Russia are being updated, leading to an increase in the
                                efficiency of natural gas use, which is equivalent to a decrease in the specific
                                consumption of natural gas per unit of output of ferrous metals. This means that
                                the I/O coefficient describing the flow from the natural gas production sector to
                                the ferrous metal production sector should be reduced proportionally.

                                Currently, a unit of new technologies is being developed.
                                It includes the estimates of the resources and materials use by new and
                                traditional technologies for the production of electricity and road transport.
                                The production of electric vehicles requires less ferrous metals, more non-ferrous
                                metals and electrical equipment (batteries methodologically belong to this category)
                                compared to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Solar generation
                                requires significant volumes of metals, concrete and silicon at the investment stage.
                                Wind generation requires significant volumes of concrete, metals, composites and
                                polymers at the investment stage. Therefore, the spread of low-carbon technologies
                                will cause structural transformations in the economy. In the CONTO model, such
                                processes are described through the redistribution of I/O coefficients (a).

                                CONTO pays special attention to the socioeconomic development of Russia. Therefore,
                                in addition to the parameters related to the energy sector, there are indicators
                                which significantly determine the economic dynamics in the country. These arise
                                from the fact that Russia is a key supplier of hydrocarbon fuels to the world market.
                                This leads to high dependence of macroeconomic indicators on the situation in
                                foreign markets, and also increases the role of fiscal policy.

                                In Russia, crucial attention is paid to the issue of sparking economic growth after
                                a long recession. That is why the fundamental step in developing national climate
                                policy is to provide the comprehensive scientific knowledge of potential
                                climate-oriented ways to positively affect the economy growth and quality
                                of people’s lives.

                                In the Russian case study, the key policy-relevant
                                investigations may be focused on searching the trajectories of effective decarbonisation
                                of the country that is both in line with its national socioeconomic targets and aligned
                                with a low-carbon world:

                                    What is the structure of the Russian energy balance, consistent with the Paris

                                since they will compete for limited financial resources. Therefore,

                                TERI’s MARKAL-India model is a bottom-up customised MARKAL model for the Indian
                                energy and environmental policy context. It is based on a rational expectation
                                hypothesis of inter-temporal optimisation with perfect foresight. The energy service
                                demands are estimated in useful energy terms and supply is met through all energy
                                technologies available currently and forecast for entry in India. The model works out
                                the most optimal set of choices based on minimisation of the total discounted system
                                cost of the energy sector under various scenarios. The MARKAL-India model is a dynamic
                                LP (linear programming) model of the Indian energy system. It uses LP methods to solve
                                for the technology mix that best meets the specified objectives. It is demand-driven
                                and feasible solutions are obtained only if all specified end-use energy demands are
                                satisfied for every time period. The end use demands for each sector and for each time
                                period are exogenously estimated. The elements of the model simulate the flow of energy
                                in various forms (energy carriers), from the sources of supply (import, export, mining,
                                and stockpiling) through transformation systems (resource, process, conversion, and
                                demand technologies) to the devices that satisfy the end-use demands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The model runs over a 50-year period, from 2001 to 2050, at five-year intervals.
                                In the model, the Indian energy sector is disaggregated into five major energy
                                consuming sectors, namely agriculture, commercial, industry, residential, and transport.
                                Each of these sectors is further disaggregated to reflect the sectoral end-use demands.
                                On the supply side, the model considers various energy resources that are available
                                both domestically and from abroad for meeting various end use demands. These include
                                both the conventional energy sources, such as coal, oil, natural gas, hydropower, and
                                nuclear power, as well as renewable energy sources (RES), such as wind, solar, biomass,
                                and so on. The availability of each of these fuels is represented by constraints in the
                                supply side. The relative energy prices of various forms and sources of fuels dictate
                                the choice of fuels, which play an integral role in capturing inter-fuel and
                                inter-factor substitution within the model. Some of the studies that have used TERI’s
                                MARKAL model include TERI (2006; 2012; 2013; 2015), Sachs et al. (2014), and Sharma
                                and Kumar (2016).

                                The China-MAPLE model consists of an energy system optimisation
                                module which is based on the TIMES modelling framework. TIMES is a modelling
                                platform for local, national or multi-regional energy systems, which provides
                                a technology-rich basis for estimating how energy system operations will evolve over
                                a long-term, multiple-period time horizon (Loulou and Labriet, 2007). It follows a
                                techno-economic (bottom-up) approach to describe the energy sectors in many details
                                through a variety of specific technologies characterised with their technical and
                                economic parameters. TIMES offers thus a detailed representation of energy sectors,
                                which includes extraction, transformation, distribution, end uses, and trade of
                                various energy forms and materials. TIMES computes an equilibrium on energy markets
                                (partial equilibrium) and determines an optimal configuration of the energy systems
                                to satisfy service demands at a minimum cost over a long-term horizon, while
                                respecting GHG emission limits.

                                The MAPLE model simulates the investment and operation of major energy technologies
                                under constraints of emissions reductions of GHGs and pollutants in local regions
                                in China. The model can project and simulate future energy use trends in reference
                                scenarios and other comparative scenarios of varying degrees of mitigation action.
                                The calculation objective of the model is that the total cost of the energy system
                                must reach the minimum while exogenously given energy demand and any other major
                                constraints on the energy system (e.g. technology availability and growth rates)
                                are satisfied. The costs include investment costs, residual values of assets,
                                fixed and variable operating costs and maintenance costs, local energy extraction
                                costs, the costs of energy imports beyond China, gains from exports to regions
                                outside of China, major energy transmission and distribution costs, related taxes
                                and additional subsidies.

                                The MAPLE version 1.0 model has one region
                                (China), i.e. the analysis is based on the national level.
                                In version 2.0, for the residential sector, the geographic
                                granularity of the model includes 31 provinces (regions).
                                That is because the residential sector accounts for a large amount of particulate
                                matter (PM2.5) emissions, and MAPLE aims to analyse the co-benefits of emissions
                                reductions for air quality. For the most recent version, more regions have been
                                developed for other sectors, including the residential, electricity, and
                                industrial sectors and sub-sectors.

                                When explicitly referring to the electricity sector,
                                it is possible to include intra-annual time slices by
                                season and day-night, to represent the specific variation in electricity supply
                                (such as from time- and weather-dependent renewables like wind and solar
                                photovoltaics) and demand during different typical periods of the day and
                                year (e.g. winter versus summer, day versus night).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Time-slices are especially important whenever the mode and cost of
                                production of an energy carrier at different times of the year are
                                signiﬁcantly different (Loulou and Labriet, 2007). This is the case
                                for instance when the demand for an electricity ﬂuctuates across the
                                year and a variety of technologies may be chosen for its production at
                                given times of the year (such as wind power when wind resources are high,
                                and solar photovoltaics when there is a high availability of solar radiation).
                                In such cases, the matching of supply and demand requires that the activities
                                of the technologies producing and consuming the electricity be tracked—and
                                matched—in each time slice.

                                The general socioeconomic parameters, including GDP growth rate, population,
                                urbanisation rate, and industry structure, are exogenous. The current socioeconomic
                                modelling assumption is consistent with the model of the World Bank (2012) and other
                                literature. The average annual growth rate of the GDP of China will drop to nearly
                                6.2% in 2020 and will further decrease to approximately 4% after 2030. The model
                                assumes a population growth scenario in which having a second child is publicly
                                allowed. Based on various sources (Zeng et al., 2013), the model assumes that the
                                total population of China will gradually increase from 1.36 billion in 2010 to
                                1.433 billion by 2020, peak by 2025-2030, and thereafter decrease to 1.385 billion
                                by 2050. The urbanisation rate of China reached 54.77% in 2014; the rate will reach
                                58.2% in 2020, 67.1% in 2030, and 75.2% in 2050. These assumptions can be varied in
                                light of updated socioeconomic projection information.

                            <h4 class="mb-0 heading-new">Energy demand drivers</h4>
                            <p>
                                In the TIMES modelling framework, the economic, population and sectoral growths are
                                used to determine specific drivers for the growth in energy demands in reference
                                scenarios with no climate change mitigation policy. For example, the demand for
                                the number of billion kilometre-vehicles (BVkm) travelled by automobiles is based
                                on GDP per capita, whereas the growth in the demand for residential space heating
                                is driven by the number of households. Once the drivers for the different energy
                                demands represented by NATEM are determined and quantified, the construction of
                                the reference demand scenario requires computing a set of energy service demands
                                over the horizon. This is done by choosing elasticities of demands to their
                                respective drivers, in each region, using the following general formula:
                            </p>
                            <p align="center">
                                <i>
                                    Demand = Driver <sup>Elasticity</sup>
                                </i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, for example the number of billion vehicle
                                km travelled by automobiles (BVkm) grows by a factor that is
                                the growth in the GDP per capita in a region to the power of a pre-defined elasticity:
                            </p>
                            <p align="center">
                                <i>
                                    BVkm = (GDP/capita) <sup>Elasticity</sup>
                                </i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In most cases the elasticities (which vary over time) are less than 1 and decrease
                                over time. For example, an elasticity of 0.8 means that a 10% increase in the growth
                                of GDP per capita in a region would result in an 8% increase in billions of vehicle
                                kilometres driven. Over time this could reduce to a much smaller elasticity,
                                reflecting empirical evidence that demand for energy services such as automobile
                                transport ultimately saturates with rising incomes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The TIMES modelling framework also has the capability of estimating the price-based
                                response of these energy service demands to the changing conditions of scenarios in
                                which mitigation occurs. For example, if the cost of energy increases as fossil
                                fuels are replaced by renewables, or because fossil-subsidies are reduced, then
                                the demand for energy services could decrease. To do this, TIMES uses another set
                                of inputs, namely the price elasticities of the demands for each energy service
                                considered. The model can then calculate the new demands for these policy cases.

                                Calibration concludes with the base year calibration, which mainly includes the
                                following aspects: (i) total energy consumption and category-based energy
                                consumption of various sectors and sub-sectors; (ii) total energy consumption
                                and category-based energy consumption of third-level sub-sectors; (iii) energy
                                consumption per unit of end-use demand of major divisions; (iv) CO2 emissions;

                                Energy consumption of sub-sectors of the industrial sector is derived on the basis
                                of energy consumption statistics given in the year 2010 (2015 in the updated

                                China is on the critical stage of its energy transformation reform
                                and meeting its NDC target for 2030. As a technology-rich model, and
                                like other bottom-up models, mitigation/adaptation measures and
                                technologies can be reflected by constraints for commodities and processes.
                                Referring to the “five-year plan” series, detailed emission standard and
                                mitigation technologies are reported for each sector, especially for final
                                demand sectors.

                                Demand for end-use energy services is the basis of analysis of the bottom-up
                                energy model. Useful energy provided by end-use energy equipment satisfying
                                demand for end-use energy for the current year is a prerequisite for analysis
                                of energy system optimisation. The demand for end-use energy services pertaining
                                to the Chinese regional model is classified into four major sectors, namely the
                                industrial sector, the transportation sector, the building sector
                                (commercial/residential sector), and the agricultural sector and others,

                                The differences between China-MAPLE and other bottom-up models for China is mainly
                                reflected in four aspects:
                                <li>China-MAPLE integrates local pollutant control and co-benefit modules into the
                                    energy system framework, and models local pollutant emission control measures
                                    and technologies in key areas.
                                </li>
                                <li>With regard to the local pollutant module, the link between local emissions and
                                    energy systems is based on technical rather than activity levels to reflect the
                                    mitigation effects of technological advances and structural adjustments. Regarding
                                    the benefit evaluation module, it describes the benefits of local pollutants
                                    obtained through emissions reduction.
                                </li>
                                <li>China-MAPLE introduces energy supply curves in the energy supply module.
                                    The supply of coal, oil and natural gas includes both domestic production and
                                    imports, avoiding deviations caused by fixed energy costs.
                                </li>
                                <li>MAPLE model is currently applied in the World Bank Group project on
                                    China’s energy modelling project, with consideration of linking the
                                    bottom-up model with a typical top-down computable general equilibrium approach.

                                TIMES is a dynamic least-cost optimisation model, and as such contains three
                                components: an objective function, variables, and constraints. The first
                                component (objective) corresponds to minimising the net total discounted cost
                                (e.g. 3-5% is typically used in deep decarbonisation studies) of the entire
                                energy system. A single optimisation, which searches for the maximal net
                                total surplus, simulates market equilibrium for each commodity (energy, material,
                                demand). Maximising the net total surplus (i.e. the sum of producers’ and consumers’
                                surpluses) is operationally done by minimising the net total cost of the energy
                                system. The second component (variables) corresponds mainly to future investments
                                and activities of technologies at each time period, amount of energy produced or
                                consumed by technologies, as well as energy imports and exports. An additional
                                output of the model is the implicit price (shadow price) of each energy form,
                                material and emission, as well as the reduced cost of each technology (reduction
                                required to make a technology competitive). The third component (constraints)
                                corresponds to various limits (e.g. amount of energy resources available)
                                and obligations (e.g. energy balances throughout the system, useful energy
                                demand satisfaction) to be respected.

                                The main model assumptions leading to optimal outputs include
                                future technological developments and the structure of energy markets.
                                On the one hand, technological progress is exogenously assumed, and
                                economic agents have a perfect foresight of this. On the other hand,
                                energy markets are assumed to be under perfect competition. Moreover,
                                TIMES considers only energy markets, and thus equilibrium is not assumed
                                for all markets in the economy. From that perspective, TIMES computes
                                only a partial equilibrium on energy markets.

                                China is a country with a large difference in energy production and consumption
                                technologies among provinces. As a bottom-up technology-rich model, a large number
                                of data and parameter collection processes are required. The main parameters include:
                                <li>Technical parameters: efficiency, availability factor, lifetime, stock for base
                                    year, etc.

                                Taking the technical parameters of the power sector as an example, power
                                generation technologies mainly include thermal, nuclear and renewable energy power
                                generation technologies. Coal power and natural-gas-based power generation
                                constitutes the main technology of thermal power generation in China. With
                                regard to technical parameters of three typical coal-fired units, power
                                production efficiency of the supercritical unit is approximately 41-42%,
                                coal consumption per unit of power generation being about 310 grams of coal
                                equivalent (gce)/kWh, and that of the ultra-supercritical unit is 45%-47%,
                                coal consumption per unit of power generation standing at about 280 gce/kWh.
                                The natural gas power generation technology in the base year is mainly natural
                                gas-based gas turbine technology and gas-steam combined cycle units. Natural gas
                                in China has the merits of higher efficiency, relatively environmental protection,
                                smaller floor area and shorter construction period compared with coal-fired power
                                generation. Because construction and operating costs of nuclear power plants are
                                relatively high (about three times that of thermal power plants), its power
                                generation cost is higher (about 0.42-0.54 Yuan/kWh on average). Furthermore,
                                power generation technologies involving wind power, solar energy, biomass, small
                                hydropower and other sorts of renewable energy also play an important role in China's
                                power production.

                                The North American TIMES Energy Model (NATEM) is an optimisation model
                                that belongs to the TIMES family of models—for a brief explanation of TIMES see
                                the MAPLE model description in Section 3.6.1. NATEM is currently the only
                                detailed optimisation model in North America. The 23-region model optimises the
                                entire integrated energy systems, as well as non-energy GHG emitting sectors, of
                                Canada, the United States and Mexico. By capturing the large diversity of energy
                                systems and policies across the three countries using a consistent modelling
                                approach, it provides a rational framework for supporting adequate decision-making
                                related to climate policies over the 2050 horizon. Model results have been used by
                                decision makers from public and private organisations to draft the Climate Action
                                Plan, identify research priorities for reducing mitigation costs, prepare energy
                                transition outlooks, assess the impacts of energy projects and evaluate circular
                                economy strategies.

                                NATEM offers a comprehensive representation of the energy system of each of the
                                North American jurisdictions (Figure 3.8). It also models inter-jurisdictional
                                and international flows of energy and material commodities. The model is driven
                                by a set of about 70 end-use demands for energy services in five sectors:
                                agriculture, commercial, industrial, residential and transportation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the energy supply side, NATEM captures all sectors including electricity
                                and heat generation in many details. Other supply sectors include fossil fuels
                                extraction, upgrading and transport, uranium extraction and transport,
                                petroleum refining, bioenergy production, natural gas liquefaction and exports,
                                hydrogen supply chain, etc. Primary energy resources include conventional
                                and unconventional fossil fuels reserves (oil, gas, and coal), renewables
                                potentials (hydro, geothermal, wind, solar, tidal and wave), uranium reserves
                                and biomass (various solid, liquid and gaseous sources). Carbon capture options
                                are available in the electricity and industrial sectors. Sequestration potentials
                                exist for enhanced oil recovery, in oil and gas fields (onshore and offshore) and
                                in deep saline aquifers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In each sector, a repository includes a large number of new technologies that
                                are in competition to satisfy each end-use demand including existing technologies,
                                improved versions of existing technologies and new technologies.

                            <p>The time horizon over which NATEM simulates the evolution of the energy system is
                                divided into a user-chosen number of time-periods. The model is currently solved
                                for the 2011-2050 timeframe through ten time periods of variable lengths. Short
                                time periods (1 to 2 years) are defined at the beginning of the horizon, while
                                longer time periods (5 years) are considered afterward, as uncertainties related to
                                data are increasing over time. Current milestone years (for which results are
                                generated) are: 2011, 2013, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050.
                                All years in a given period are considered identical. For all quantities such as
                                installed technology levels, power plant capacities and energy and emissions flows,
                                any annual input quantity (e.g. coal used in a power plant per year) or output
                                quantity (e.g. electricity generated from the coal plant per year) related to a
                                given time period applies identically to each of the years in that period.</p>

                                In addition to the multi-year time periods described above, in NATEM there
                                are time divisions <b>within</b> a year, called “time slices”,
                                which may be deﬁned by the user, so as to capture different weather,
                                consumer behaviours, and energy demand conditions at different times of
                                the year. There are currently sixteen time slices representing four
                                seasons a year (spring, summer, fall and winter) and four intraday
                                periods (day, night, morning peak, evening peak). The MAPLE model
                                documentation (Section 3.6.2.4) provides further detail of the purpose
                                of time-slices in the TIMES framework.

                                The model tracks all GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
                                nitrous oxide (N20), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs),

                                forcing and the temperature change over pre-industrial times.

                                The NATEM model requires inputs concerning the degree to which energy service
                                demands, as well as demand for other goods and services which result in GHG
                                emissions, will grow over the course of next decades in the different countries.
                                It does this by using various socioeconomic inputs, as described below. Data will
                                be revised and updated before running the model under the PARIS REINFORCE project.

                                Demands for energy services are currently projected through 2050 using a coherent
                                set of socioeconomic assumptions from the projections of the National Energy Board
                                (NEB, 2017) for Canada, from the Annual Energy Outlook (EIA, 2018) for the United
                                States, and various national sources for Mexico (CONAPO, 2012; SENER, 2014;
                                PRODESEN, 2018). Demands for energy services are projected using national sources
                                specific to the three countries and not a single source. Demands are ultimately
                                projected through 2050 from the 2011 base year using the following growth index

                                The growth in the industrial, agricultural and commercial sectors in each region is
                                partially derived from the national’s overall GDP growth, with each sector’s share
                                of total GDP changing over time, and from the expected/planned production levels,
                                constructions, and development of certain activities. These shares are derived
                                from a historical analysis of how all countries’ sectoral shares of output have
                                changed as their overall output grew. Growth of residential households is derived
                                from population growth and assumptions on average household size in each region.
                                Growth in each of these sectors drives energy demand as described in the next

                                optimisation model databases used worldwide, research projects in several
                                universities with important Canadian research funding, consulting projects for
                                public and private organisations in North America, constant technology watch and
                                literature review, and collaboration with world class energy modellers to develop
                                rigorous assumptions and robust approaches through ETSAP-IEA. With thousands of

                                attributes, and hundreds of commodities, many datasets can be extracted and reported.

                                As for all the TIMES-based models, the NATEM predominantly works by specifying
                                either a GHG price (e.g. a carbon tax) or a GHG limit (e.g. an upper bound
                                constraint) in one or several regions, or alternatively for all regions
                                simultaneously. Additionally, the following further policies and measures can be
                                implemented: subsidies or taxes on specific technologies, renewable portfolio

                                This allows NATEM to perform a number of energy and climate policy-relevant
                                investigations. Indeed, NATEM has been used to assess the implications of meeting
                                ambitious GHG mitigation goals on the energy system configuration and cost, under many
                                different economic and technical assumptions. Model results have been used by decision
                                makers at national, regional and city levels in North America to

                            <p>
                                SISGEMA is a hybrid environmental-economic model for assessing economic and
                                environmental impacts of alternative land uses in Brazil. The model augments the
                                standard economic accounting matrix—in monetary terms—by introducing environmental
                                accounting that represents ecosystem services variables—in physical terms—in the
                                economic modelling. In nature, it is similar to the EU’s NAMEA (National Accounting
                                Matrix with Environmental Accounts) project. The model can be used to analyse
                                different scenarios of policies and other factors that have an impact on land use,
                                such as the necessary price levels for and impacts of an effective Payment for
                                Ecosystem Services (PES), the investment requirements of implementing Brazil’s
                                Forest Code, and the impacts of using alternative assumptions related to
                                deforestation rates, land prices, costs of recovering forest areas (e.g.
                                labour costs) and of preserving forest areas (for example, interest rates), among
                                others. Since the model is spatially disaggregated at the municipal level (over five
                                thousand municipalities in the Brazilian territory), it is possible to aggregate
                                results according to different criteria (biomes, geographic and administrative
                                regions, etc.) and to establish analytical comparisons with other variables
                                available at the municipal level. SISGEMA is developed by the Environmental and
                                Sustainable Development Group of the Economics Institute at the Federal University
                                of Rio de Janeiro (GEMA–IE/UFRJ).

                            <h4 class="mb-0 heading-new">Components</h4>
                            <p>
                                The model comprises two main components. The first component refers to quantifying
                                the costs of preserving and recovering forest areas. Cost of forest preservation is
                                based on estimates of land use opportunity costs, i.e. on the compensation land
                                owners would have to receive to give up agriculture and, instead, adopt practices
                                to preserve ecosystem services. Three alternative models to estimate opportunity
                                costs have been developed, and the mean of each models’ results is used. Results
                                are provided for each of the Brazilian 5,700 “munícipios” (local administrative unit
                                , similar to UK counties). The latest estimate is that an average amount of R$
                                403/hectare/year (approximately EUR 102/hectare/year) could compensate
                                the maintenance of ecosystem services provision in half of Brazil’s
                                municipalities – but it is important to note that there are strong
                                heterogeneities among regions. Cost of forest recovery is calculated by estimating
                                costs of fencing, inputs and labour, also per município. Estimates show that the
                                median of this cost is R$ 7,466/hectare/year (approximately EUR 1,892/hectare/year).
                                These results show that maintaining ecosystem services provision is much cheaper
                                than recovering forest areas. This cost is then added to the opportunity cost in
                                areas where forest areas have been depleted. Based on these two sets of costs,
                                supply curves of preserving ecosystem services and recovering forest areas are
                                estimated, respectively.

                                The second component of the model concerns introducing ecosystem services into the
                                model. This component constitutes the hybrid component of the model, i.e. the
                                modelling of ecosystem services in physical units, established in a geographic
                                information system (GIS), in a framework that is integrated with economic
                                accounting—i.e. with economic variables in monetary units. Adjusted by the
                                different stages of forest growing, this component provides estimates of carbon
                                captured by forests, methane emissions related to alternative cattle raising
                                practices, soil erosion and biodiversity, also for each “município”. This allows,
                                for instance, to quantify a supply curve of avoided deforestation (and related
                                avoided CO2e emissions) subject to different carbon prices.

                                            would be much lower: it would culminate in 37% less CO­2 emissions
                                            avoided/captured, and 40% less soil erosion avoided. In addition,
                                            a significant portion of the values transacted would be concentrated
                                            in the Caatinga biome, which would alone account for 68.2% of total

                                As with MAPLE and NATEM, TIMES-CAC uses the TIMES modelling framework,
                                as described in Section 3.6.1. The integrated bottom-up partial-equilibrium
                                energy system model of the Central Asian Caspian (CAC) Area, titled TIMES-CAC,
                                assembles the four separate but structurally-consistent single-region TIMES
                                country models of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan<sup>2</sup> by
                                interconnecting them through the representation of energy flows and
                                emission permits exchanges. The multiregional model is thought and
                                designed as a comprehensive framework, able to explore national
                                and/or supra-national forces, in a long-time horizon (until 2050),
                                with the aim to test the effects of long-term energy export strategies
                                on the energy system of the CAC countries and analyse trade-off curves
                                between “risk” indicators and key KPIs, such as the system cost, the
                                quantities exported and the corresponding revenues, as well as the
                                emission reduction ambitions.

                                The key components of the TIMES-CAC model are the
                                technologies for the production of primary and
                                secondary commodities (mining and extractions
                                processes, power plants, refineries, etc.)
                                together with the most representative appliances and devices
                                of the demand sectors (boilers, light bulbs, road vehicles, etc.).
                                The energy system development of each model region is driven by a
                                set of demands for energy services in all sectors: agriculture,
                                residential, commercial, industry, and transportation.

                                The time horizon over which TIMES-CAC simulates the evolution of the energy system
                                is divided into a user-chosen number of time periods. In its default (current)
                                version, the model runs from 2011 (base year) to the medium-to-long term through
                                six periods (the representative years of which are: 2011, 2013, 2020, 2030, 2040,
                                and 2050). All years in a given period are considered identical. For all quantities,
                                such as installed technology levels, power plant capacities and energy and emissions
                                flows, any annual input quantity (e.g. coal used in a power plant per year) or output
                                quantity (e.g. electricity generated from the coal plant per year) related to a given
                                time period applies identically to each of the years in that period.

                                In the framework of the project, the model can be further calibrated to different
                                references years and run different horizons/organisation of periods, if necessary.

                            <p>
                                As is the case for almost all the most important energy-producing countries, the CAC
                                countries are also highly dependent on energy exports, and this dependence results
                                in a very large share of the energy sector to the GDP and fundamental (critical)
                                contributions to the State budgets. Economic growths are based on national specific
                                projections for the medium-term, and on hypotheses (study- and scenario-specific)
                                for the longer horizon. In general terms, the analysed storylines always assume a
                                (quite fast) growth in domestic GDPs for all the cases and countries, that in a
                                baseline case is equivalent to a an economic trend of around +4.5% (in terms of GDP,
                                in average, to 2050).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But due to the abovementioned characteristics, economic growths in the CAC area
                                (by country) should be always properly assessed and considered within a
                                self-consistent (energy-related) storyline, in order to keep a certain degree of
                                robustness of the scenario and of the projections.

                            <p>
                                Population growths are also based on national (local) specific information in the
                                medium term and on assumptions in the longer horizon (mainly inherited by a specific
                                analysis for Kazakhstan), that result in a population growth rate of +1.2%, in
                                average, in the long-term (2050), for the multiregional area. It is worth noting
                                that, according to some local experts, the international analyses often
                                “underestimate” the population growth rates of the area, due to the incorrect
                                comparison with Russia (and the Former Soviet Union) and with the Russian ethnic
                                groups (lower birth rates).
                            </p>

                                The growth in the industrial, agricultural and retail business sectors in each region
                                is partially derived from the national’s overall GDP growth, with each sector’s share
                                of total GDP changing over time, and from the expected/planned production levels,
                                constructions (e.g. square meters for services), and development of certain
                                activities. Growth of residential households is derived from population growth and
                                assumptions on average household size in each region.

                                The TIMES-CAC model is calibrated for the initial period (currently 2011) using a
                                combination of IEA world energy statistics for the year 2011 and country-specific
                                information, with the projections for the key energy-related investments and stocks
                                (e.g. installed technology capacity) further calibrated until 2013-2015. The current
                                intention is that the version of TIMES-CAC to be used in PARIS REINFORCE will have
                                an updated energy statistics calibration (the most useful combination among the key
                                international and local sources) to the most recent years. The main variables to be
                                calibrated include: the capacities/stocks and operating levels of all technologies;
                                the extracted, exported, imported, produced, and consumed quantities for all energy
                                carriers; and the introduction/representation of recent (new) policy- and
                                target-related elements (if any).

                                TIMES-CAC is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and
                                low-carbon technologies that are envisaged to be available (for those systems)
                                for at least the first half of the 21st century. By simulating the substitution of
                                low-carbon for high-carbon technologies in response to their relative costs, as well
                                as emissions constraints and/or carbon prices, the model simulates mitigation. The
                                principal energy sector CO2 (and non- CO2) mitigation options are shown in the
                                following table (the options that are not currently available but can be added in the
                                model are marked with an asterisk*). Data will be revised and updated in the
                                framework of the PARIS REINFORCE project, and in accordance with the international
                                database and feedback of local experts.

                            <p>
                                The modelling framework and solution rationale is similar to the MAPLE and
                                NATEM models, as detailed for MAPLE in Section 3.6.7.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The TIMES-CAC model computes a dynamic inter-temporal partial equilibrium for
                                the (multi-) regional energy and emission markets, based on the maximisation of
                                total surplus defined as the sum of surplus of the suppliers and consumers. In
                                other words, it is assumed that the multi-regional system evolves, while
                                maintaining intra-temporal and inter-temporal partial economic equilibrium,
                                and always occupies the technical possibility frontier. The process of solving the
                                model determines the optimal mix of technologies (capacity and activity) and fuels at
                                each period, the associated emissions, the mining and “trading activities”, the
                                quantity and prices of all commodities, all in time series from the base year
                                to the time horizon of the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The model was mainly developed and used to assess the dynamics of the national
                                energy system of the area in cooperative and non-cooperative manner, when energy
                                export levels are determined by the willingness-to-pay of the different
                                “importers/customers”<sup>3</sup>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The model responds to economic incentives (such as revenues from the exports)
                                by optimising the domestic energy system (supply and demand of each energy form),
                                the energy exchanges within the multiregional system (CAC area), and with the
                                external markets, in an “integrated” manner. A “discount” factor of 5% per year is
                                usually used to value the costs of the energy system at different time points in
                                the future. In other words, a cost of $100 one year in the future would be equated
                                to a cost of $95 today. This discount factor can be changed. Implicit discount
                                rates are also used at sectoral level.

                            <p><i>3: Model can currently run in two modes: with exogenously defined export levels
                                per each direction of export, or with endogenously defined export levels through
                                the most profitable route and destination. A risk-specific analysis can also be
                                enabled to strategise the export of the region. </i></p>

                                The TIMES-CAC model is “by paradigm” a technology-rich tool, where techno-economic
                                information is assigned to each process (existing and future) of the system, and
                                therefore many datasets/parameters can be extracted and reported.

                                Based on the geopolitical and strategic role of the CAC area in the international
                                “energy” context, and on its specific technical and market characteristics that affect
                                the local energy and climate plans, the following key information is selected as the
                                “most important” parameters to monitor, discuss and evaluate in the framework of the
                                PARIS REINFORCE project for a successful integration of this model with the other
                                tools and analyses:

                                    with respect to the gas allocation: domestic use vs. export), and national
                                    emission reduction goals.

                            <h4 class="mb-0 heading-new">Key policies that can be addressed</h4>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                As for all the TIMES-based models, TIMES-CAC predominantly works by specifying
                                either a carbon price (imposed as a tax) or a carbon emissions constraint in
                                each region that it represents, or alternatively all regions simultaneously.
                                For example the following further policies can be implemented:
                                <li>Minimum/maximum capacity factors on fossil fuel power generation plants
                                    (e.g. to simulate minimum or maximum desired levels of operation);
                                </li>
                                <li>Subsidies on particular technologies (through adjusting their costs or the
                                    explicit assignment of incentives);
                                </li>
                                <li>Constraints on the availability of particular technologies (e.g. “no nuclear”,
                                    variable renewables accounting for no more than 50% of electricity generation);
                                </li>
                                <li>Constraints on the growth rates of particular technologies (e.g. carbon capture
                                    and storage power generation capacity cannot grow at more than 20% per year)
                                </li>
                                <li>Inter-regional emissions trading (or no trading);</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                More in particular, TIMES-CAC is capable of exploring the direct economic advantage
                                of cooperation policies in the energy and climate change mitigation sectors for the
                                represented countries. The following cooperation policies in the area can be directly
                                modelled:
                                <li>exploitation of Caspian oil and natural gas resources;</li>
                                <li>investment in the construction of cross-national new pipelines;</li>
                                <li>maintenance of free exchange in the energy sector across the region; and</li>
                                <li>creation of a joint CO2 emission permit system in the area.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, the structure of the TIMES-CAC model allows to fully include the
                                concept of “energy security” in the analysis (from the perspective of energy
                                exporters), and to test the effects of long-term energy export strategies in
                                the CAC region by exploring the trade-offs between a “risk” indicator and some
                                key variables of the energy system such as the total cost, the quantities exported
                                and the corresponding revenues, the climate targets of the region. Furthermore,
                                (export) risk reduction goals can be combined with securing a minimum level of
                                revenues from the hydrocarbon exports goals, with the aim to quantitatively
                                evaluate the response of the energy sector and its sensitivity to different
                                export strategies.

                                transport, building heating and cooling, and the powering of industrial
                                manufacturing plants). In multi-region versions of the model, fuel trading between
                                regions is also estimated. The TIMES framework is usually applied to the analysis
                                of the entire energy sector, but may also be applied to the detailed study of
                                single sectors (e.g. the electricity and district heat sector). The framework can
                                also be used to simulate the mitigation of non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases,
                                including
                                methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O).

                                The TIMES Integrate Assessment Model, TIAM, is the multi-region, global version of
                                TIMES, which combines an energy system representation of fifteen different regions
                                with options to mitigate non-CO2 greenhouse gases as well as non-energy CO<sub>2</sub>
                                mitigation
                                options, such as afforestation in each of these regions. It uses emissions from these
                                sources to calculate temperature changes using a simple climate module. As such, it
                                can be used to explore a variety of questions on how to mitigate climate change
                                through energy system and transformations, as well as reductions in non-energy
                                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

                                The time horizon over which TIAM simulates the evolution of the energy system is
                                divided into a user-chosen number of time-periods. In the TIAM version to be used
                                in PARIS REINFORCE, a starting period of 2005 is selected, with further periods
                                including 2006-7, 2008-2015 (called 2012), and then ten-year periods of 2016-2025
                                (2020), 2026-2035 (2030), and so on, until 2096-2105 (2100). All years in a given
                                period are considered to be identical. For all quantities such as installed
                                technology levels, power plant capacities and energy and emission flows, any annual
                                input quantity (e.g. coal used in a power plant per year) or output quantity (e.g.
                                electricity generated from the coal plant per year) related to a given time period
                                applies identically to each year in that period.

                                divisions within a year, called “time slices”, which may be deﬁned by the user, so
                                as to capture different weather and energy demand conditions at different times of
                                the year. Currently, there are six time-slices, representing summer daytime, summer
                                night time, winter daytime, winter night time, and “transition season” day time and
                                night time. Time slices are especially important whenever the mode and cost of
                                production of an energy carrier at different times of the year are signiﬁcantly
                                different (Loulou and Labriet, 2007). For instance, when the demand for electricity
                                ﬂuctuates across the year and a variety of technologies may be chosen for its
                                production at given times of the year (such as wind power when wind resources are
                                high, and solar photovoltaics when there is a high availability of solar radiation).
                                In such cases, the matching of supply and demand requires that the activities of the
                                technologies producing and consuming the electricity be tracked—and matched—in each
                                time slice.

                                The climate module in TIAM uses emissions that are calculated within the model, as a
                                result of the energy system’s operations, as well as any mitigation of non-energy
                                CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases. The model tracks the three main sources
                                of greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and
                                nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). TIAM’s climate module calculates changes in the
                                atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O,
                                and as a consequence the change in atmospheric radiative forcing (which leads to
                                global warming) compared to pre-industrial times, and finally the temperature change
                                over pre-industrial times for the atmosphere and the deep ocean. Figure 8 gives a
                                graphical overview of the module‘s structure.

                                The TIAM model requires inputs concerning the degree to which energy demand, as
                                well as demand for other goods and services which result in GHG emissions (such as
                                agricultural demand) will grow over the course of the 21st century. This is achieved
                                by using various socioeconomic inputs, as described in this section.

                                Economic growth is based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways variant 2 (SSP2),
                                sometimes called the “middle-of-the-road” scenario as it generally follows recent
                                past trends in demographic, social, economic and lifestyle developments (Fricko et
                                al., 2017). TIAM specifically uses the OECD projections for SSP2. This results in a
                                growth in world Gross Domestic Product to $540 trn in 2005$ Purchasing Power Parity
                                terms, by 2100, compared to $100 trn in 2020 (Dellink et al., 2017).

                                all countries’ sectoral shares of output have changed as their overall output grew.
                                Growth of residential households is derived from population growth and assumptions

                                The economic, population and sectoral growths are used to determine specific drivers
                                for the growth in energy demands in a “reference” scenario where no climate change
                                mitigation takes place. For example, the demand for the number of billion
                                kilometer-vehicles (bvkm) travelled by automobiles is based on GDP per capita,
                                whereas the growth in the demand for residential space heating is driven by the
                                number of households.

                            <p>
                                Once the drivers for the different energy demands represented by
                                TIAM are determined and quantified, the construction of the reference demand
                                scenario requires computing a set of energy service demands over the horizon.
                                This is done by choosing elasticities of demands to their respective drivers,
                                in each region, using the following general formula:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Demand = Driver <sup>Elasticity</sup>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, for example, the number of billion vehicle km travelled by automobiles,
                                bvkm, grows by a factor which is the growth in the GDP per capita in a region
                                to the power of a pre-defined elasticity:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                bvkm = (GDP/capita)<sup>Elasticity</sup>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In most cases, the elasticities (which vary over time) are less than 1, and decrease
                                over time. For example, an elasticity of 0.8 means that a 10% increase in the growth
                                of GDP per capita in a region would result in an 8% increase in billions of vehicle
                                kilometres driven. Over time this could reduce to a much smaller elasticity,
                                reflecting empirical evidence that demand for energy services such as automobile
                                transport ultimately saturates with rising incomes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                TIAM has the capability of estimating the price-based response of these energy
                                service demands to the changing conditions of scenarios in which mitigation occurs.
                                For example, if the cost of energy increases as fossil fuels are replaced by
                                renewables, then the demand for energy services would decrease. To do this, TIAM uses
                                another set of inputs, namely the price elasticities of the demands for each energy
                                service considered. TIAM can then calculate the new demands for these mitigation
                                cases.

                                2015. The main variables to be calibrated are: the capacities and operating levels of
                                all technologies, the extracted, exported, imported, produced, and consumed quantities
                                for all energy carriers, and the emissions if modelled.

                                TIAM is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and low-carbon
                                technologies that are envisaged to be available for at least the first half of the
                                21st century. By simulating the substitution of low-carbon for high-carbon
                                technologies in response to their relative costs, as well as emissions constraints
                                and/or carbon prices, the TIAM model simulates mitigation. The principal energy
                                sector CO2 mitigation technology options are as shown in Table 16:

                                TIAM also contains a range of non-energy CO2 and non-CO2 mitigation options, albeit
                                in a relatively simplified form. For non-energy CO2, the key option is afforestation.
                                For methane (CH4), these options are:
                                <li>Farm scale digesters for manure.</li>
                                <li>Anaerobic digestion, composting, heat production, electricity generation and
                                    flaring from landfill methane.
                                </li>
                                <li>Minimisation of methane leaks from fossil fuel extraction and distribution,
                                    and/or flaring of methane to (lower global warming potential) carbon dioxide gas.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                For nitrous oxide (N2O) these options are:
                                <li>Thermal destruction of gas from adipic acid production</li>
                                <li>
                                    Catalytic reduction of gas from nitric acid production
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to the above mitigation options, the TIAM model has recently
                                been developed to simulate the deployment and operation of a range of advanced
                                technologies, including Direct Air Capture for CO2 removal and sequestration
                                (Realmonte et al., 2019) and even hyper-loop terrestrial high speed transport to
                                substitute for some domestic aviation trips (Napp et al., 2019). In principle many
                                other energy technologies could be simulated in the model.

                                TIAM simultaneously calculates the quantity of production and consumption of the
                                different “commodities” accounted for in the model. These commodities are the
                                different energy forms, the different quantities of deployed technologies, and the
                                different quantities of energy services. The price of producing a commodity affects
                                the demand for that commodity, while at the same time the demand affects the
                                commodity’s price. TIAM operates in a market-clearing manner, such that prices of
                                commodities are consistent with the supply and demand being in balance for all
                                commodities.

                            <p>TIAM most commonly operates on a perfect foresight principle, such that it has
                                knowledge of all current and future technology costs and fuel supply curves. This
                                allows it to reach a cost-minimising level of commodity production and consumption,
                                which is consistent with meeting all current and future energy demands, as well as
                                any imposed emissions constraints. The total energy system cost (including any losses
                                to consumers’ welfare as a result of energy price rises) is calculated as a Net Present
                                Value (NPV) cost of the energy system over the whole time period until 2100. A
                                “discount” factor of 5% per year is used to value the costs of the energy system at
                                different time points in the future. In other words, a cost of $100 one year in the
                                future would be equated to a cost of $95 today. This discount factor can be changed.

                                each process (existing and future) of the system, and therefore many data/parameter
                                values can be extracted and reported.

                                TIAM predominantly works by specifying either a carbon price (imposed as a tax) or a
                                carbon emissions constraint in each region that it represents, or alternatively all
                                regions simultaneously. For example, the following further policies can be implemented:
                                <li>
                                    Minimum / maximum capacity factors on fossil fuel power generation plants
                                    (e.g. to simulate minimum or maximum desired levels of operation);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Subsidies on particular technologies (through adjusting their costs);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Constraints on the availability of particular technologies (e.g. “no nuclear”,
                                    variable renewables accounting for no more than 50% of electricity generation);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Constraints on the growth rates of particular technologies (e.g. carbon capture
                                    and storage power generation capacity cannot grow at more than 20% per year)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Inter-regional emissions trading (or no trading);
                                </li>

                                This allows TIAM to perform a number of policy-relevant investigations, such as:
                                <li>
                                    What are the energy system cost and energy technology and fuel mix implications
                                    of imposing emissions or climate constraints earlier or later in the century, in
                                    different regions at different times and to different levels of stringency?

                                  MUSE is a modelling environment for the assessment of how national or multi-regional
                                  energy systems might change over time. Its scope is the entire energy system, from
                                  production of primary resources such as oil or biomass, through conversion of these
                                  resources into forms of energy for final consumption, and finally the end-use
                                  consumption of that energy to meet economy-wide service demands.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  MUSE is an agent-based framework, in that it explicitly characterises the
                                  decision-making process of firms and consumers in the energy system, thereby
                                  capturing a variety of features of market imperfection. MUSE is also
                                  technology-rich, in that it characterises the cost and performance of each technology
                                  option, tracks technology stock, and provides details on investment, operating costs,
                                  energy consumption, and emissions with a detailed bottom-up perspective.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The agent-based modular structure of the sectors is brought together in a partial
                                  equilibrium on the energy system through a market clearing algorithm, which balances
                                  supply and demand of each energy commodity. The market clearing algorithm is also
                                  able to enforce a carbon budget, which escalates a carbon price until agents in all
                                  sectors respond and emissions constraints are met.
                              </p>
                              <p>MUSE-Global is an implementation of a global model in the MUSE framework,
                                  characterising 28-regions of the world, and running over a time horizon of 2010 to
                                  2100. It can be used to explore a variety of questions on how to mitigate climate
                                  change given realistic constraints and frictions on system change, and has been
                                  applied to show that slightly sub-optimal transition pathways may be more likely
                                  to succeed than optimal ones.

                                  The time horizon over which MUSE simulates the evolution of the energy system is
                                  divided into a user-chosen number of time periods. In MUSE-Global, to be used in
                                  PARIS REINFORCE, there is a starting period of 2010, with further years divided
                                  in ten-year periods up to 2100. All years in a given period are considered identical.

                                  In addition to the multi-year time periods described above, in MUSE there are time
                                  divisions within a year, called “time slices”, which may be deﬁned by the user,
                                  so as to capture different resource supply, weather and energy demand conditions
                                  at different times of the year. This is the case for instance when the demand for an
                                  electricity ﬂuctuates across the year and a variety of technologies may be chosen
                                  for its production at given times of the year (such as wind power when wind
                                  resources are high, and solar photovoltaics when there is a high availability of
                                  solar radiation).

                                  is dealt with via the imposition of emissions limits on each time period.
                                  The model tracks the three main sources of greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide
                                  (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O).
                                  These gases are tracked for each technology, sector, region and for the world,
                                  in each time period.

                                  between 1970 and 2015) are regressed against the exogenously given macroeconomic
                                  drivers (GDP and population) (Figure 14, from Kerdan et al., 2019d).

                                  The economic, population and sectoral growths are used to determine specific drivers
                                  for the growth in energy demands in a “reference” scenario in which there is no
                                  climate change mitigation. For example, in the agricultural sector, demand for one
                                  of the services is linked to demand for food. Being highly correlated with income
                                  and population growth, the regression model used in MUSE is represented in the
                                  following equation, because of the best fit with historical demand of food:
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  log C = a + b * ln(GDPpc)
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  where C represents the consumption of food per capita and GDPpc is the region GDP
                                  divided over the population.

                                  MUSE does not include endogenous own-price elasticity. Instead, demand changes may
                                  be modelled via sensitivity analysis.

                                  As described above, MUSE uses an agent-based formulation to determine possible
                                  pathways of energy system transition. As such, socioeconomic categorisation of
                                  populations of investors and/or consumers is used to capture heterogeneity in
                                  investment decision making. The technique relies upon survey data, and widely
                                  available socioeconomic metrics, e.g. from the World Bank to achieve this. For
                                  example, in the building sector the SINUS-Milieus Typology (Sinus Sociovision, 2017)
                                  was used for the classification and attributes assignment of agents. According to the
                                  methodology introduced above, socioeconomic survey data of household representative
                                  persons can be adopted to allocate households into social groups.

                                  The MUSE model is calibrated for the initial period (2010) using IEA world energy
                                  statistics for the year 2010, with the projections for energy, installed technology
                                  capacity and emissions further calibrated to 2015. The main variables to be
                                  calibrated are the capacities and operating levels of all technologies present in
                                  the world in 2010; the extracted, exported, imported, produced, and consumed
                                  quantities for all energy carriers; and the emissions.

                                  MUSE is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and low-carbon
                                  technologies that are envisaged to be available for at least the first half of the
                                  21st century. As described above, the calibration process determines what technologies
                                  existed in the global energy system in the base year. The principal energy sector CO2
                                  mitigation technology options are as shown in Table 20:

                                  MUSE simulates a microeconomic equilibrium on the energy system. It consists of
                                  modular independent agent-based sector modules, joined together by a market clearing
                                  algorithm, as shown in Figure 11.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The market clearing algorithm iterates across all of the sector modules,
                                  interchanging price and quantity of each energy commodity in each region, until an
                                  equilibrium is reached. It sends commodity prices to the end-use sectors and receives
                                  back demand for each of these commodities. It sums up these demands and sends them
                                  to the conversion and/or supply sectors, which in turn send back a price. This is
                                  used to inform an updated price in the market clearing algorithm, whence the
                                  procedure iterates again (i.e. updated prices are sent to the end-use sectors, etc).
                                  Eventually this process results in a microeconomic equilibrium for each energy
                                  commodity in each region. When investigating climate change mitigation, a carbon
                                  budget is imposed on each time period. A GHG emissions price is then set in the
                                  market clearing algorithm such that the carbon budget is achieved (i.e. by pricing
                                  emissions, and thereby incentivising investment in low emissions technology in all
                                  sectors via the agent-based modelling described below).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Each agent-based sector module in MUSE is modelled in a way that is appropriate for
                                  that sector (i.e. MUSE is a hybrid modular approach). As such, MUSE developers are
                                  able to characterise investment decision making in different ways in each sector,
                                  to capture the features that are the most important and therefore produce a more
                                  realistic representation of energy system transitions. MUSE uses socioeconomic and
                                  firm-level data and analyses to characterise a set of investment decision makers
                                  (agents) for each sector. Each sector then applies an agent-based modelling (ABM)
                                  approach where “agents” (firms or consumers) apply rules to (a) determine which
                                  technologies will be considered for investment; (b) calculate a set of objectives
                                  according to their decision making preferences; and (c) use a method to combine
                                  these objectives to make a final investment decision. Each of these steps is bespoke,
                                  where developers can choose from a set of pre-defined rules or can code and add their
                                  own objectives and decision rules.

                                  As such, overall MUSE is a limited-foresight model that strives to represent the frictions and challenges that could occur as the world aims for systemic technology change to achieve climate change mitigation over the coming eight decades. Data paucity, technology cost and performance uncertainty, and spatial and temporal coarseness are all weaknesses of this approach, as they are with any other form of integrated assessment modelling.

                                  The MUSE model requires inputs concerning the degree to which energy demand, as well as demand for other goods and services which result in GHG emissions (such as agricultural demand), will change over the time horizon. Future demand projections of each service in each region are based on societal input variables, i.e. population and GDP.

                              MUSE is usually applied by specifying either a carbon tax or a carbon emissions constraint for the world as a whole. This acts as a proxy for all other climate-related policies. However, a further range of policy levers are possible to implement in MUSE, as follows:
                              <li>
                                  Capacity factor limits on fossil fuel power generation plants (e.g. to simulate minimum or maximum desired levels of operation)
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Subsidies on particular technologies (through adjusting their costs)
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Constraints on the availability of particular technologies (e.g. “no nuclear”, variable renewables accounting for no more than 50% of electricity generation, etc.)
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Constraints on the growth rates of particular technologies (e.g. CCS power generation capacity cannot grow at more than 20% per year), addition of capacity (e.g. cannot grow more than 5 GW per year, and cumulative capacity limits (e.g. cannot exceed 60 GW in total, ever).
                              </li>
                          </ul>

                              <p>MUSE does not calculate non-climate SDGs. However, it is possible to take MUSE’s outputs and perform “off-model” calculations to estimate many of the SDG implications. For example, MUSE reports the quantity of offshore wind power plants in each of its reporting years. This allows an estimation of the employment that such activity would generate in the region. Furthermore, MUSE may be coupled with macroeconomic and/or lifecycle assessment tools in order to calculate SDG-relevant quantities; for example, impact on income distribution, impact on air or water quality, etc.</p>

In this context where bioenergy supply reduces, new investments would be necessary to boost the existing gas infrastructure capacity.</td>

Brazil is expected to liberate up to 68.4 Mha of agricultural land by 2050. If this land is abandoned, the country carbon stock could be reduced from 135.9 PgC in 2010 to 129.9 PgC. If a sugarcane expansion policy is followed, by mid-century the carbon
                                          stock could reach 134.2 PgC, whereas if a reforestation policy is implemented it could reach 139.2 PgC.

Results show the importance of reforestation as a significant contributor to carbon sequestration. Brazil has the potential to sequester around 5.6 GtCO2 by 2050 through reforestation. In this scenario, the capital investment in carbon sequestration and storage would be substantially reduced.

The integration of several decision-making steps including information gathering, the assessment of the performance of each option as well as the final selection enables a more flexible and realistic representation of the energy system change compared to the majority of the energy systems models. The agent-based method leads to a range of technologies in the market during a transition phase, continuous investment in low capital cost technologies, and eventually the emergence of a low carbon system based on new mass market technologies.

Global space heating demand reflect not only population and temperature characteristics but also the correlation of gross domestic product with the ownership of air conditioning equipment. In terms of energy density, the results show that a relatively small portion of demand (approx. ∼ 5%) occurs at very high energy density locations (i.e. above 36.9 GW h/km2), while ~50% of demand occurs in low energy density locations (i.e. below 1.79 GW h/km2).

                                  42 is a simulation model for estimating CO2 emissions associated with energy consumption in a wide range of countries, dividing the world into 50 countries and regions. The key goal of the model is to describe the target characteristics of the perspective energy sector in different countries for their effective integration into the global process of regulating emissions. The model is used to calculate the impacts of possible structural changes, as well as of improvements in the efficiency of energy use. The energy sector of all countries is described in detail in the form of energy balances, synchronised with the methodology of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Modelling is based on a bottom-up approach: first, the final consumption of energy resources is estimated for the industrial, transport, residential, and services sectors; and then model calculates the necessary amount of primary energy resources needed to produce petroleum products, electricity and heat. Key influencing factors include changes in the fuel structure of electricity and heat production; changes in the efficiency of electricity and heat production based on different types of fuel; changes in the structure of vehicle fleet (for cars and trucks); changes in energy consumption per capita; and changes in energy efficiency in manufacturing sectors of the economy.

                                  42 does not have a climate module and does not calculate the impact of anthropogenic emissions on climate change. The current version of the model tracks only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It may be expanded during the implementation of the PARIS REINFORCE project, in order to provide a more complete description of anthropogenic emissions.

                                  42 requires a number of socioeconomic metrics, according to which both energy
                                  consumption and energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are modelled.
                                  The key parameters concern economic growth and its structure, population, vehicle
                                  fleet and energy intensity for each country/region under consideration. The current
                                  version of the 42 model contains relevant and representative data for all of these
                                  dimensions.

                                  Population growth is one of the primary causes of world energy consumption increase. The UN demographic forecast is usually employed as a basis for population scenarios. The reference (medium) scenario assumes an increase in the global population to 9.5 billion by 2045 (average annual growth rate of 0.7%). 42 does not consider population structure (e.g. by age group, urbanisation status, etc.).

                                  Another driver for increasing energy consumption is economic growth. Currently, scenario hypotheses on the GDP growth rates for all the countries and regions under consideration are set in accordance with calculations on economic forecasting models performed by the team of the Institute of Economic Forecasting of the Russian Academy of Sciences. According to these estimates, global GDP will increase 2.45 times, from 110 (currently) to 270 trillion dollars (2011 PPP) by 2045. However, 42 can use any hypotheses on GDP growth as inputs.

                              <p>
                                  The structure of GDP is also an important metric, since different sectors are characterised by various levels of energy intensity. The 42 model distinguishes the following components of the total value added in the economy of all countries/regions: material production, transport, and services. The ratio of these segments is analysed basing on an econometric approach.

                                  Road transport is an important energy consumer, providing about 40% of global oil demand. The vehicle fleet size reflects the economic situation: the growth of household income stimulates the purchase of a private vehicle, and economic development creates a cargo flow for transportation. Further development of the world economy is associated with an increase of the fleet size. The reference scenario for the car fleet in Russia is defined as population times the automobilisation rate. At the same time, the automobilisation rate depends on GDP per capita (the relationship between these parameters is described by an S-shaped curve, which is similar to consumer demand saturation). However, its future dynamics can be significantly transformed. The modern generation of young people is less interested in buying a personal car, and new technologies make a sharing-based model of transportation affordable and convenient. The development of online services and remote work can also reduce the demand for mobility. Given these factors, transportation and fleet forecasts vary widely.

                                  Nowadays, the most crucial trend is government incentives to change the structure of the automotive market in the direction of low-carbon solutions (electric vehicles). Therefore, structural shifts in the fleet constitute another key socioeconomic metric for future energy consumption. Simulating the growth of the share of low-carbon transport is a way of modelling climate change mitigation.

                                  Economic and demographic development provide gross characteristics of energy demand.
                                  However, energy efficiency is superimposed on these, slowing the increase of global
                                  consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In the 42 model, there is no relationship
                                  between the investment process and energy efficiency. Instead, energy intensities
                                  of different industries are inputs to the model.

                                  The logarithmic approximation is used as typical dynamics of energy intensity curves
                                  in different industries. It is characterised by damping dynamics and is well suited
                                  to describe the logic of energy consumption process evolution. The growing logarithmic
                                  curve produces a situation of increasing consumption, as it implies that the role of
                                  an energy resource is strengthened in a specific economic sector (for instance,
                                  electrification of residences and services; increase in electric equipment in
                                  industries of developing countries; spread of carbon-free resources in developed
                                  countries). The falling logarithmic curve produces situations either of improving
                                  the efficiency or of consumers moving away from a particular energy source (for
                                  instance, a replacement of coal).

                                  42 is a simulation model focused on the implementation of low-carbon solutions in the
                                  field of electricity and heat production, and automobile transport. By simulating the
                                  substitution of low-carbon for high-carbon technologies, the 42 model simulates
                                  mitigation. The principal energy-sector CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation technology options
                                  are as
                                  shown in Table 24. Particular attention is paid to improving the efficiency of energy
                                  consumption through the simulation of energy intensity curves.

                              <p>
                                  Modelling is based on a bottom-up approach: first, the final consumption of energy
                                  resources is estimated for industry, transport, the residential sector, and services;
                                  and then the model calculates the necessary amount of primary energy resources needed
                                  to produce petroleum products, electricity and heat. The amount of primary energy
                                  consumption in these two phases explains the total energy consumption, which is
                                  multiplied by the carbon intensity vector and thus CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with
                                  the energy sector are calculated.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The process of energy consumption is modelled as a combination of three classes of influencing factors:
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Consumption = Gross factor * Structural factor * Technological factor
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                              Gross factor characterises the size of an object consuming energy. The examples of such factors distinguished are as follows:
                              <li>GDP (gross factor for the entire economy)</li>
                              <li>population (gross factor for residential sector)</li>
                              <li>vehicle fleet (gross factor of transport sector)</li>
                              <li>electricity production (gross factor of power sector)</li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                              The structural factor is necessary in order to identify which part of the “gross” object consumes a particular energy product. The following structural factors are distinguished:
                              <li>GDP structure (shares of value added in material production, transport and services in relation to GDP)</li>
                              <li>
                                  electricity production structure (it determines how much electricity will be generated on the basis of different types of energy resources)
                              </li>
                              <li>vehicle fleet structure (it shows how many cars will consume different types of motor fuels)</li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                                      The technological factor is necessary in order to describe the dynamics of specific energy consumption. For example, how much natural gas is needed to produce 1 kWh of electricity; how many litres of diesel are needed to drive 100 km by car; how much energy is needed to create 1 million USD of value added in the services. The following technological factors are distinguished:
                              <li>vehicle fuel efficiency per 100 km</li>
                              <li>efficiencies of power generation technologies</li>
                              <li>energy intensity of value added in different s</li>
                                  </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Using all these key drivers of future energy demand as model inputs, the 42 is focused on energy-associated CO2 emissions calculation according to a simulation-based approach.

                              Model 42 offers a simulation-based description of energy consumption processes. Therefore, in addition to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, it requires parameters of CO2 mitigation measures in terms of structural and technological features of the energy sector. A list of key parameters for all countries under consideration is given below:
                              <li>vehicle fleet and its structure (depending on the people’s mobility hypothesis);</li>
                              <li>structure of electricity and heat production (may be based on the countries’ goals within the framework of the Paris Agreement or more ambitious targets);</li>
                              <li>energy intensities of different sectors;</li>
                              <li>fuel efficiency for cars and trucks (may be based on countries technical regulation of automotive industry and markets); and</li>
                              <li>fuel efficiency for electricity and heat plants.</li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  These parameters should be set to take into account existing goals of the national climate policy implemented by the countries under consideration, as well as to define the most efficient structure of the energy sector that is in line with the goals of the selected level of climate change mitigation (be that the Paris Agreement goals or scenarios of increased ambition).

                              As a simulation model, 42 predominantly works by adjusting the structural characteristic and efficiency parameters of energy-consuming sectors. In addition, the emission limits being adopted by countries may be used as a simulation target. The following policies can be implemented during the calculations:
                              <li>goals for renewable energy-based electricity generation in benchmark years;</li>
                              <li>restrictions of the capacities/production for the power plants based on the fossil fuels;</li>
                              <li>restriction or complete ban on sale and use of conventional (internal combustion engine) cars;</li>
                              <li>stimulation of energy efficiency in terms of decreasing energy intensities of value added and energy consumption per capita; and</li>
                              <li>restriction of CO2 emissions associated with energy consumption.</li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  42 may help to implement policy-relevant investigations, focused on searching the objective parameters, which are consistent with a low-carbon future, of national energy sectors of a wide list of countries. The overarching question the model aims to address is: <i>what is the structure of the energy balance, in consistency with the Paris Agreement?</i>

We demonstrate the practical use of a modelling ensemble (which includes the 42 model) on the example of construction of agreed world oil production, consumption and price scenarios, interrelated with perspective parameters of the world economy and energy sector. The conditions and parameters of relatively high and low world oil prices scenarios are described.

                              <p>
                                  GEMINI-E3 is a multi-country, multi-sector, recursive computable general equilibrium
                                  (CGE) model. It simulates all relevant markets, domestic and international, considered
                                  as perfectly competitive, which implies that the corresponding prices are flexible in
                                  markets for commodities (through relative prices), for labour (through wages), and
                                  for domestic and international savings (through rates of interest and exchange rates).
                                  Time periods are linked in the model through endogenous real rates of interest
                                  determined through the balancing of savings and investment. National and regional
                                  models are linked by endogenous real exchange rates resulting from constraints on
                                  foreign trade deficits or surpluses. There is one notable—and usual—exception to
                                  this general assumption of perfect competition, which concerns foreign trade.
                                  Goods of the same sector produced by the different countries are not supposed
                                  to be perfectly competitive; they are considered as economically different goods,
                                  more or less substitute according to an elasticity of substitution known as the
                                  Armington assumption. The main outputs of the GEMINI-E3 model are on a country
                                  and annual basis: carbon taxes, marginal abatement costs and prices of tradable
                                  permits (when relevant), effective abatement of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, net sales of tradable
                                  permits (when relevant), total net welfare loss and components (net loss from terms
                                  of trade, pure deadweight loss of taxation, and net purchases of tradable permits
                                  when relevant), macro-economic aggregates (e.g. production, imports and final demand),
                                  real exchange rates and real interest rates, and data at the industrial level (e.g.
                                  change in production and in factors of production, and prices of goods).

                                  Like other CGE models, GEMINI-E3 covers all economic activities. In this version,
                                  the model divides the economy into eleven sectors, each one of which produces a
                                  good. Five of the sectors are related to the energy sector, three represent the
                                  transport sector, one covers the energy-intensive industries, and the remaining
                                  two sectors are agriculture and other goods and services. Table 27 provides the
                                  detailed industrial classification of GEMINI-E3.

                                  The energy sectors are represented similarly to other economic sectors by using
                                  nested CES functions.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  For electricity production, GEMINI-E3 distinguishes fossil fuel (i.e. coal, natural
                                  gas and oil power plants), nuclear, hydro, solar and wind power plants. Power
                                  generation is separated from the other activities (transmission and distribution)
                                  that appear through their factors of production at the top of the nesting structure.
                                  Power generation involves only two factors of production: capital and fuel for fossil
                                  fuel power plants and capital and a resource for renewables. With this nesting
                                  structure it is possible to better take into account the power generation portfolio
                                  and to represent inter-fuel substitutability as well as substitutability between
                                  fossil and renewable power generation. The model allows the use of carbon capture and
                                  storage (CCS) technology for coal and gas power plants when the carbon price is above
                                  the full cost of CCS.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Coal, crude oil and natural gas sectors include a fixed factor that represents the
                                  non-renewable resource associated with each fossil fuel energy. For these sectors we
                                  suppose that the domestic production is realised with this fixed factor and the other
                                  standard inputs (i.e. capital, labour, material and energy) through, again, a nested
                                  CES function.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Finally, refined petroleum products are produced from the basic input, i.e. crude oil.
                                  The model considers this specificity with a CES function between crude oil and other
                                  standards inputs at the top level of the nested CES structure.

                                  GEMINI-E3 is a recursive-dynamic, yearly model, with backward-looking (adaptive)
                                  expectations. The model simulates the global economy up to 2050. The base year of the
                                  model is 2014.

                                  The building and calibration of the CGE model rest on economic and energy data that
                                  are usually contained in comprehensive databases, specially established for this
                                  purpose. In particular, this version of GEMINI-E3 is built on GTAP-10 (Aguiar et al.
                                  2019), a database that accommodates a consistent representation of energy markets in
                                  physical units (tons of oil equivalent) as well as detailed socio-accounting matrices
                                  in USD for a large set of countries or regions and bilateral trade flows. The GTAP
                                  database is completed by other information especially on indirect taxation and
                                  government expenditures, mainly coming from the International Energy Agency (IEA),
                                  OECD and the International Monetary Fund. Important efforts have been put into
                                  harmonising all these sources of information. The result is a consistent social
                                  accounting matrix for each country/region.

                                  Carbon emissions are directly computed from fossil energy consumption in physical
                                  quantities using coefficient factors that differ among firms (i.e. sectors),
                                  households and regions.

                                  The representation of non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is based on the GTAP
                                  Non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHG emissions (NCGG) dataset (Rose and Lee, 2008). The database
                                  distinguishes several emissions of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide
                                  (N<sub>2</sub>O) and fluorinated gases. The emissions of each source are linked to an
                                  activity level (or an economic driver). Abatements by gases are computed from the EPA
                                  abatement curves (EPA 2013).

                                  Forests can mitigate GHGs by storing carbon, therefore GEMINI-E3 computes carbon
                                  sequestered by forest. We use forest mitigation supply functions computed by Favero
                                  et al. (2018), which use the Global Timber Model (GTM) to simulate the optimal
                                  management of forest land for climate change mitigation under several carbon price
                                  paths. These supply curves allow to compute the carbon sequestered by forest in
                                  each region.

                                  As other global macroeconomic models, GEMINI-E3 determines endogenously all economic
                                  variables by sectors, regions and years. The model computes the level of production
                                  (and the inputs associated: labour, capital, energy, and materials) but also demand
                                  (household demand, investment and export) by sectors/goods and regions. The prices
                                  associated to each good are determined endogenously. However, the dynamic of the
                                  model in the baseline scenario is mainly driven by exogenous variables that are

                              GEMINI-E3 provides in a consistent way numerous economic variables at global and
                              national/regional levels. The first set of variables is related to macroeconomic
                              indicators such as:
                              <li>GDP</li>
                              <li>Households and government consumptions</li>
                              <li>Investment</li>
                              <li>Exports and imports</li>
                              <li>Government saving</li>

                              <p>
                                  These variables are expressed in volume (i.e. at the base year prices),
                                  but the prices associated to each of these macroeconomic aggregates are also computed
                                  (prices of GDP, of household consumption, etc.).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                              The second set refers to sectoral data:
                              <li>Production by sector</li>
                              <li>Demand by sector and by usage (final demand, intermediate use)</li>
                              <li>Production factors by sector (labour demand, energy consumption, capital, etc.</li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Again, for these sectoral data, changes in price and in volume are computed.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Finally, the model gives the international flows of goods and services (i.e.
                                  imports and exports) between the regions/countries described by the model.

                                  For each sector and region, the model computes total demand as the sum of final
                                  demand (investment, consumption and exports) and intermediate consumptions by all
                                  sectors. Then, demand is split between imports and domestic production according
                                  to the Armington assumption. Domestic production technologies are described through
                                  nested CES functions, which differ according to the sector. For example, Figure 17
                                  shows the nested CES production structure of the sector producing “other goods and
                                  services”. Production is done with four aggregates: capital, labour, material and
                                  energy. In a second step (nest), material and energy are decomposed in individual
                                  goods using again CES functions.

                                  Household behaviour consists of three interdependent decisions: 1) labour supply;
                                  2) savings; and 3) consumption of the various goods and services. In GEMINI-E3,
                                  both labour supply and the rate of savings are assumed to be exogenous. Demand
                                  in the different commodities has prices of consumption and income (more precisely
                                  "spent" income, i.e. income after savings) as arguments and is derived from nested
                                  CES utility functions, described in Figure 18. At the first level of the consumption
                                  function, households choose between three aggregates: housing, transport and other
                                  consumptions. Energy consumption is split into two parts: for transportation and
                                  housing purposes. Transport demand is split into purchased and own transports. The
                                  model distinguishes three types of personal vehicles depending on the fuel used.
                                  Electric vehicles (EV), which are mainly dedicated to short or medium distance, and
                                  two other types using the same motorisation (i.e. internal combustion, or IC), one
                                  using petroleum products and the other biofuels. Each vehicle is characterised by a
                                  vehicle capital (called powertrain in Figure 19) and a type of fuel used (refined oil,
                                  biofuel or electricity).

                                  Total government consumption is exogenous and its evolution over time, determined in
                                  the calibration of the model, is driven by the growth rates of the main aggregates of
                                  the economy. The model splits total consumption between goods based on fixed budget
                                  shares.

                                  The exports are the sum of imports by all other countries/regions that are
                                  endogenously determined in the model.

                                  Investment by products is derived from investment by sectors through a transfer
                                  matrix. Investment by sector is determined from an "anticipated" capital demand
                                  using the CES function of each sector. Anticipated production prices and demands
                                  are based on adaptive expectations.

                              GEMINI-E3 was mainly designed to assess climate change and energy policies. The model can
                              simulate climate change policies in two ways:
                                    <li>
                                        First, based on climate targets (or pathways) as the ones defined by COP21 (see
                                        Babonneau et al., 2018a), the model can evaluate the carbon prices that will be
                                        needed to reach these goals.
                                    </li>
                              <li>
                                  However, the model can also evaluate the impact on GHG emissions associated to a
                                  carbon tax defined by government (see Babonneau et al., 2018c).
                              </li>
                          </ol>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Climate change policies can be evaluated through the implementation of a carbon tax or
                                  an emissions trading system. The carbon tax can be uniform among countries/regions and
                                  sectors or be differentiated. The model can simulate a carbon tax framework coupled
                                  with an emissions trading system (see Babonneau et al., 2018b). Within these climate
                                  policies, other constraints such as nuclear moratorium or non-price policies (such as
                                  emission standards) can also be analysed (see Babonneau et al., 2018c).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Usually the carbon tax revenue is recycled by the government to households through a
                                  lump sum transfer in order to keep constant the surplus or deficit of the government.
                                  But other recycling rules can be implemented in the model.
                              </p>
                            <p>GEMINI-E3 computes not only the carbon prices associated to climate change policies but
                                also welfare changes. A consistent measure of welfare cost is the household’s surplus.
                                Deriving demand by households from a utility function then allows one to have a direct
                                economic measure of the welfare cost of abatement policies. Households surplus may be
                                directly reckoned from the numerical results of scenarios, for every year and every
                                country/region, and they can be aggregated in various ways: either weighted by exchange
                                rates and summed for a given year or period, or discounted through interest rates for a
                                given country and then measuring the total discounted cost of the abatement policy. To
                                eliminate the effects of changes in the relative prices of foreign trade, one must
                                subtract the marginal gain (or loss) from changes in the terms of trade (GTT) to
                                marginal welfare loss. This yields the so-called deadweight loss (DWL) of taxation.
                                The GTTs represent spill-over effects due to changes in international prices. In a
                                climate change policy, these GTTs come mainly from the drop in fossil energy prices
                                that result from the decrease of world energy demand.

                                  GEMINI-E3 was not originally designed to assess the sustainable development goals
                                  (SDGs). However, some indicators related to economic growth (SDG8), energy (SDG7) and
                                  climate (SDG13) can be evaluated directly from outputs of the model. Some other
                                  indicators may be analysed by performing some computations outside the model or by
                                  coupling GEMINI-E3 with other models.

                                              estimated at 8 billion € within a full Brexit. However, this cost is less

                                  ICES is a recursive-dynamic multi-regional Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model
                                  developed to assess impacts of climate change on the economic system and to study
                                  mitigation and adaptation policies. The model’s general equilibrium structure allows
                                  for the analysis of market flows within a single economy and international flows with
                                  the rest of the world. This implies going beyond the “simple” quantification of
                                  direct costs, to offer an economic evaluation of second and higher-order effects
                                  within specific scenarios of climate change, climate policies and/or different trade
                                  and public-policy reforms in the vein of conventional CGE theory. The model is linked
                                  to the Aggregated Sustainable Development goal Index (ASDI) module that generates
                                  scenario and policy specific projections up to 2030 (2050) of selected SDG indicators
                                  allowing to assess the systemic implication of implementing a policy on countries’

                                  ICES is a computable model: all the model behavioural equations are connected to the
                                  GTAP 8 database (Narayanan, Badri, & McDougall, 2012), which collects national social
                                  accounting matrices from all over the world and provides a snapshot of all economic
                                  flows in the benchmark year (2007). All economic flows related to fuel-specific energy
                                  production and consumption derive from GTAP-Power database (Peters, 2016) and are
                                  merged to GTAP 8 database.

                                  In order to perform a sustainability analysis, the GTAP database has been integrated
                                  with international statistics in order to single out the following sectors: Research
                                  and Development (R&D), Education, and Health. For the R&D sector, the indicator “R&D
                                  expenditure as percentage of GDP” from the World Development Indicators - WDI (World
                                  Bank 2016) and the “share of R&D financed by Government, Firms, Foreign Investment
                                  and Other National” from the OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators (OECD 2016)
                                  are used for attributing R&D to the different economic agents. A similar approach has
                                  been used for Education and Health sectors. Data on overall expenditure on health and
                                  education have been obtained from the WDI database (World Bank 2016).

                                  The ICES database has been further extended following the model developments regarding
                                  the public actor (Delpiazzo, Parrado, & Standardi, 2017). In addition to government
                                  revenues and expenditures already included in GTAP 8 database, other monetary flows
                                  have been made explicit: international transactions among governments (foreign aid
                                  and grants) and transactions between the government and the private households (net
                                  social transfers, interest payment on public debt to residents), flows among
                                  governments and foreign private households (interest payment on public debt to
                                  non-residents), and public debt.

                                  The model’s economic database is complemented with satellite databases on energy
                                  volumes (McDougall & Aguiar, 2008), CO<sub>2</sub> and non‐CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
                                  (Rose & Lee, 2008;
                                  Lee, 2008), which include nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>),
                                  and three fluorinated
                                  gases (F‐gases). Both energy volumes and emissions have an endogenous dynamic in the
                                  models and evolve the former, according to energy sector production, and the latter,
                                  proportionally to energy combustion processes (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions) and sectoral
                                  and
                                  household use of agricultural and energy commodities. GHG emissions do not include
                                  emissions from LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry). The median trend of
                                  GHG emissions across IAM scenarios (IIASA database) is targeted given the pattern of
                                  energy prices and adjusting sector-specific efficiency in energy use.

                                  The model is largely driven by the set of possible futures envisioned by the climate
                                  change community and known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (O’Neill, et al.,
                                  2017). These are five possible futures with different mitigation/adaptation challenges
                                  and are characterised by different evolutions of main socioeconomic variables. SSPs
                                  can be linked to Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that envision the GHG
                                  emission evolution and forcing and temperature rise due to specific patterns of
                                  socioeconomic growth (Riahi, et al., 2017).

                                  SSPs provide future patterns for population, working age population and GDP at

                                  our simulation. The GDP trend is instead a target to be met through a mix of country
                                  and sector-specific productivities that are exogenously set (primary factor and total
                                  factor productivity).

                                  In our reference scenarios, the growth of GDP, population and employment reproduces
                                  historical trends up to 2014 (WDI 2016) and then mimics SSP growth rates
                                  (OECD projections). Population trend relies on the WDI database (World Bank 2018) up
                                  to 2014 and then follows SSP growth rates (IIASA-WiC projections). Employment trends
                                  rely on the WDI database (World Bank 2018) up to 2010, then consider IIASA-WiC
                                  projections of working age population and other specific assumption of SSP storylines:

                                  The ICES model includes a climate policy module that allows designing mitigation
                                  policies through explicit or implicit carbon taxes internalising or correcting the
                                  external costs of polluting activities.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In the former case, carbon taxes are introduced into the model through specific ad
                                  valorem rates depending on the source of emissions. Carbon tax rates are calculated
                                  for each emitting source as the corresponding ratio between tax revenues and the
                                  total tax base. Then, this ad valorem tax is added to the supply price and determines
                                  the market price that households and firms finally face.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In the case of implicit carbon tax, regional emission limits can be imposed (quotas).
                                  Countries/regions can exchange emission rights starting from an initial allocation of
                                  permits in order to comply with the quota. The emission trade generates the optimal
                                  allocation of abatement and the emission price. In the ICES policy module, we can
                                  restrict emissions training to a set of countries, as in the case of EU-ETS, and
                                  combine it with direct carbon taxation in other countries, or allow for a global
                                  emissions trading system.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In the module, it is also possible to design mitigation scenarios curbing the carbon
                                  leakage effect (Border Tax Adjustments - BTA).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In each country/region revenues are collected by government that can use them to
                                  reduce public debt or increase government expenditure or rebate them to support
                                  household income (transfer), to subsidise specific firms or production factors
                                  (endowments or intermediates), and to support other countries (international transfer
                                  to specific countries or to an international fund, e.g. Green Climate Fund).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In addition to carbon taxation, ICES can implement other mitigation options such as
                                  subsidising clean energy production and its use (with direct effect on government
                                  deficit), imposing behavioural shifts on household and firm energy demand (without
                                  direct effect on government deficit), improving efficiency in energy use (with/without
                                  direct effect on government deficit), and applying the above described instruments and
                                  constraints to the agriculture, livestock and forestry sectors.

                              <p>
                                  The core structure of ICES derives from the GTAP-E model (Burniaux & Truong, 2002),
                                  which in turn is an extension of the standard GTAP model (Hertel, 1997). The General
                                  Equilibrium framework makes it possible to account for economic interactions of agents
                                  and markets within each country (production and consumption) and across countries
                                  (international trade). Within each country the economy is characterised by n
                                  industries, a representative household and the government. Industries are modelled as
                                  representative cost-minimising firms, taking input prices as given. In turn, output
                                  prices are given by average production costs. The production functions (Figure 20)
                                  are specified via a series of nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES)
                                  functions. Primary factors—including natural resources, land, labour, and a
                                  capital-energy composite—constitute the Value Added Energy (QVAEN) nest,
                                  which is combined with intermediates (QF), in order to generate the output.
                                  Perfect complementarity is assumed between value added and intermediates.
                                  This implies the adoption of a Leontief production function. For sector i in region r,
                                  final supply (output)<b>Y<sub>i,r</sub></b>, results from the following constrained

                                  In the ICES production tree (Figure 20), the second nested level, on the left-hand
                                  side, represents the value added plus energy composite (QVAEN). This composite
                                  stems from a CES function that combines four primary factors: land (QLAND),
                                  natural resources (QNR), labour (QL) and the capital-energy bundle (QKE).
                                  Primary factor demand in turn derives from the first-order conditions of
                                  the following constrained cost minimisation problem for the representative firm:

                                 In turn, the capital-energy bundle combines capital with a set of different energy
                                  inputs. In fact, energy inputs are not part of the intermediates, but are associated
                                  to capital in a specific composite. The energy bundle is modelled as an aggregate of
                                  electric and non-electric energy carriers. Electricity sector differentiates between
                                  intermittent and non-intermittent sources. Wind and solar, which are intermittent
                                  sources, are separated from non-intermittent sources: hydro, nuclear, fossil and
                                  other non-fossil electricity. Economic flows detailing production and consumption of
                                  energy relies on the GTAP-Power database (Peters, 2016).

                                  The Non-Electric bundle is a composite of coal and energy from other fuels. The

                                  with natural gas and crude oil. All elasticities regarding the inter-fuel substitution
                                  bundles are those from GTAP-E (Burniaux & Truong, 2002), while for the extended
                                  renewable electricity sectors we set those values considering different studies
                                  (Paltsev, et al., 2005; Bosetti, Carraro, Galeotti, Massetti, & Tavoni, 2006).

                                  The demand of production factors (as well as that of consumption goods), can be met
                                  by either domestic or foreign commodities, which however are not perfectly
                                  substitutable according to the "Armington" assumption. In general, inputs grouped
                                  together are more easily substitutable among themselves than with other elements
                                  outside the nest. For example, the substitutability across imported goods is higher
                                  than that between imported and domestic goods. Analogously, composite energy inputs
                                  are more substitutable with capital than with other factors.

                                  In the ICES model, as in GTAP, two industries are treated in a special way and are not
                                  related to any country, viz. international transport and international investment
                                  production. International transport is a world industry, which produces the
                                  transportation services associated with the movement of goods between origin and
                                  destination regions, thereby determining the cost margin between free-on-board
                                  (or f.o.b., before freight and insurance are added) and costs-insurance-freight
                                  (or c.i.f., inclusive of transportation margins) prices. Transport services are
                                  produced by means of factors submitted by all countries, in variable proportions.
                                  In a similar way, a hypothetical world bank collects savings from all regions and
                                  allocates investments in order to achieve equality in the absolute change of current
                                  rates of return.

                                  Figure 21 describes the main sources and uses of regional income. In each region, a
                                  representative utility maximising household receives income, originated by the
                                  service value of national primary factors (natural resources, land, labour, and
                                  capital), that they own and sell to the firms. Capital and labour are perfectly mobile
                                  domestically but immobile internationally (investment is instead internationally
                                  mobile). Land and natural resources, on the other hand, are industry-specific and
                                  sluggish<sup>1</sup>.Land is used only by the agriculture and livestock sectors, and
                                  competition for land is only among these two sectors; natural resources are of three
                                  types: forestry and fishing, fossil (coal, oil and gas), and other mining. Whether a
                                  sluggish endowment is used by more than one sector, its optimal allocation responds
                                  to the revenue maximisation of a household subject to a transformation frontier
                                  (Constant Elasticity of Transformation, or CET, formulation). Both land and natural
                                  resources are monetary aggregate variables in the base year, but price and quantity
                                  changes are distinguishable in simulation years.

                                  Government income equals to the total tax revenues from both private households and
                                  productive sectors, a series of international transactions among governments (foreign
                                  aid and grants), and national government-private transfers (Delpiazzo, Parrado, &
                                  Standardi, 2017). Both the government and the private household consume and save a
                                  fraction of their income according to a Cobb-Douglas function. The government income
                                  not spent is saved, and the sum of public and private savings determines the regional
                                  disposable saving, which enters the Global Bank as in the core ICES model.

                                  by each firm/sector. Public consumption is split into a series of alternative
                                  consumption commodities according to a Cobb-Douglas specification. However, almost all
                                  public expenditure is concentrated in the specific sector of non-market services,
                                  including education, defence and health. Private consumption is analogously addressed
                                  towards alternative goods and services, including energy commodities that can be
                                  produced domestically or imported. The functional specification used at this level is

                                  The recursive-dynamic feature is described in Figure 22. Starting from the picture of
                                  the world economy in the benchmark year, by following socioeconomic (e.g. population,
                                  primary factors stocks and productivity) as well as policy-driven changes occurring in
                                  the economic system, agents adjust their decisions in terms of input mix (firms),
                                  consumption basket (households) and savings. The model finds a new general (worldwide
                                  and economy-wide) equilibrium in each period, while all periods are interconnected by
                                  the accumulation process of physical capital stock, net of its depreciation. Capital
                                  growth is standard along exogenous growth theory models and follows:

                                  By looking into GHG emissions, including non-energy and agriculture emissions, the
                                  model can inter alia be used to determine national/regional compliance with (intended)
                                  nationally determined contributions, and assess gaps from equitable and sustainable
                                  emissions.

                                  The ICES model can also be used to assess economy-wide implications of adaptation
                                  strategies (the term of comparison in this case is generally a scenario with climate
                                  change impacts), e.g. understanding the benefits of changing the crop mix in the case
                                  of impacts in agriculture or of building preventive protections in the case of sea
                                  level rise causing land loss, or delving into behavioural shifts or efficiency changes
                                  associated to climate change (e.g. higher cooling demand), which are imposed
                                  exogenously before their economy-wide implications are assessed).

                                  The ASDI (Aggregated Sustainable Development goal Index) module aims at offering a
                                  comprehensive assessment of future sustainability up to 2030 (with the capacity to
                                  extend the analysis to 2050) based upon 27 indicators related to the 17 Sustainable
                                  Development Goals, under different socioeconomic and policy scenarios. ASDI module
                                  combines a modelling framework (ICES model) with an empirical one (regression approach
                                  based on historical data) to offer an internally-consistent set-up for analysing
                                  future patterns of sustainability indicators and their inter-linkages (Figure 23).

                                  Indicator selection is guided by the following requirements: relevance in measuring
                                  the SDG they refer to and connection with a specific quantitative SDG Target.
                                  Furthermore, ASDI indicators need to have good country coverage because the
                                  well-being assessment is worldwide and the comparability of the results of aggregation
                                  procedure requires excluding countries with missing values for at least one of ASDI
                                  indicators. ASDI indicators are at country level; the presence of a macro-economic
                                  model in our framework and the world coverage forces us to disregard more
                                  disaggregated indicators (gender, cohort, location-specific).  Furthermore, the most
                                  stringent constraint in selecting ASDI indicators comes from the sustainability
                                  assessment: drawing the future path of SDG indicators depends on identifying their
                                  determinants (empirical analysis on the historical data and evidence from the
                                  literature), and, at the same time, depicting the future evolution of these
                                  determinants using the ICES model. The lack of any empirical evidence connecting an
                                  SDG indicator with one or more endogenous variable in our model determined its
                                  exclusion from ICES set of indicators. Table 31 lists all ASDI indicators, except for
                                  those referring to climate action (SDG 13).

                                  Among ASDI indicators, sixteen are computed using model results, seven require
                                  regression analyses to be linked to them (SDG1, SDG2, SDG3a, SDG3b, SDG4, SDG7a,

                                  SDG15c, SDG16). The collection of historical data of indicators relies on several
                                  international databases (World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2018), the UN
                                  database (United Nations, 2018), and World Income Inequality Database (WIID3.4)
                                  (United Nations, 2017b), and covers all available countries for the period 1990-2015.

                                  Historical data are used for initialising indicators in the base year of the model
                                  (2007) and for estimating the basic relationships between the model’s variables
                                  and indicators in the regression analysis phase. The ASDI module computes the values
                                  of the SDG indicators up to 2030 (2050) using the output of the ICES model.
                                  For the indicators not directly generated by the model, the estimated relationships
                                  from historical data with the regression analysis are used in an out-of-sample
                                  estimation procedure and combined with output variables of the model (main drivers are
                                  listed in Table 32). In order to derive SDG-specific indices (simple
                                  average of the underlying indicators) and the ASDI, ASDI indicator values are
                                  normalised, using a
                                  benchmarking procedure that identifies sustainable and unsustainable thresholds,
                                  and then aggregated.

                                              compared to the baseline scenario), especially in countries that have
                                              proposed relatively more stringent mitigation targets and suffer higher
                                              policy costs. Conversely, the impact of climate policy on inequality shows
                                              opposite sign but remains very limited. If financial support for

                                              international climate fund, the prevalence of poverty will be slightly
                                              reduced at the aggregate level, but the country-specific effect depends
                                              on the relative size of funds flowing to beneficiary countries and on
                                              their economic structure.

                                  DICE is a global integrated assessment model developed by Nordhaus (1992) that
                                  represents the economic, policy and scientific aspects of climate change. It
                                  integrates the climate system in the framework of economic growth theory. In this
                                  approach, society invests in capital goods, thereby reducing consumption today, in
                                  order to increase consumption in the future. Investing in emissions reduction reduces
                                  consumption today but also prevents damage from climate change and increases
                                  consumption possibilities in the future. The DICE model has been used and developed
                                  by researchers outside the consortium.

                                  Figure 24 shows a schematic flow chart of the major modules and logical structure of
                                  the model. The economy module includes the factors that are driving the economic
                                  growth (labour, population, capital and technology) and also the emissions of GHGs.
                                  The DICE model includes also several geophysical relationships that link the economy
                                  with the different forces affecting climate change. These relationships include the
                                  carbon cycle, a radiative forcing equation, climate-change equations and a
                                  climate-damage relationship. A key feature of IAMs is that the modules operate in an
                                  integrated fashion rather than taking variables as exogenous inputs from other models
                                  or assumptions. Therefore, the damage of climate change affects the production/output
                                  via a damage function.

                                  forcing and temperature change. These equations are calibrated for the 21st century
                                  to large models or model experiments and have been updated (version 2013R) in line
                                  with AR5 of the IPCC (for example, in the current version, the equilibrium climate
                                  sensitivity has been reduced from 3 to 2.9). The following equation represents the
                                  equations of the carbon cycle for three reservoirs (j = AT, UP, and LO): atmosphere,
                                  upper oceans and biosphere, and lower oceans. All emissions flow into the atmosphere
                                  and the parameters φij represent the flow of carbon between reservoirs per period.

                                  DICE has been helpful in illustrating the economic cost and damage from climate action
                                  under different circumstances (Nordhaus, 2014; Moore and Diaz, 2015; Butler et al.,
                                  2014; or González-Eguino, 2016) However, different studies have shown that the results
                                  of the DICE model are very sensitive to the choice of the damage function (Pindyck,
                                  2013), especially beyond 2°C. Therefore, some authors have used the DICE model using
                                  alternative damage functions (Ackerman et al., 2010 or Gonzalez-Eguino et al., 2017)
                                  and a sensitivity analysis of key parameters. Finally, the DICE model is an aggregated
                                  model that captures the economic cost of mitigation using only a cost function.
                                  Therefore, it cannot capture the complexity of the mitigation options of large-scale
                                  IAMs, such as, for example, the GCAM or TIAM models.

                                  computer-based model of the world’s economic and energy systems and the environment.
                                  It was originally developed through the European Commission’s research framework
                                  programmes and is now widely used in Europe and beyond for policy assessments,
                                  forecasting and research purposes.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  E3ME assesses the interactions between the economy, energy and the environment.
                                  As a global model, based on the full structure of the economic national accounts,
                                  E3ME is capable of producing a broad range of economic indicators. In addition, there
                                  is range of energy and environment indicators.

                                  E3ME can be used for both forecasting and evaluating the impacts of an input shock
                                  through a scenario-based analysis. The shock could be, for example, a change in
                                  policy or a change in economic assumptions. The analysis can be either forward-looking
                                  (ex-ante) or evaluating previous developments in an ex-post manner.
                              </p>

                              As such, E3ME is well-suited to examine questions regarding changes in policies. The
                              primary strength of E3ME lies in its use as a platform for the analysis of scenarios. As
                              E3ME is a global Energy-Economy-Environment model, it is capable of addressing such
                              questions as follows:
                              <li>
                                  Changes in the economy and labour market associated with changes in policy
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Impacts of changes in energy demand and changes in the composition of energy

                              As noted, E3ME is designed to form annual projections up to 2050. Therefore, E3ME is
                              commonly used to compare scenario projections. The following, non-exhaustive list shows
                              the most common model outputs:
                              <li>
                                  GDP and the aggregate components of GDP (household expenditure, investment, government
                                  expenditure and international trade)
                              </li>
                              <li>Sectoral output and GVA, prices, trade and competitiveness effects</li>
                              <li>International trade by sector, origin and destination</li>
                              <li>Consumer prices and expenditures</li>
                              <li>Sectoral employment, unemployment, sectoral wage rates and labour supply</li>
                              <li>Energy demand, by sector and by fuel, energy prices</li>
                              <li>Rebound and spill-over effects</li>
                              <li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by sector and by fuel</li>
                              <li>Other air-borne emissions</li>
                              <li>Material demands </li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Given the wide range of both economic and environmental output indicators, and the
                                  high degree of disaggregation, E3ME is capable of providing detailed projections
                                  of the impacts of policies on both the regional level as well as the sectoral level.

                                              The results suggest that absolute embodied emissions will plateau at
                                              current levels or slowly return to pre-2008- crisis levels, and
                                              differences between the NDC and baseline scenarios imply that NDC policies
                                              will not result in significant carbon leakage. The share of national
                                              footprint embodied in imports, at least for countries with ambitious
                                              decarbonisation policies, will likely increase. This suggests that,
                                              despite the world-wide stabilisation of emissions transfers, addressing
                                              emissions embodied in imports will become increasingly important for
                                              reducing carbon footprints.

                                              baseline). Investment levels increase, thereby strengthening exports’

                                              underlying socioeconomic development and the climate policy trajectory,
                                              with a to date expected range of variation, seem to play a less important
                                              role. Particularly, we find that the choice of model, with its underlying
                                              macroeconomic theory, influences the sign and magnitude of macroeconomic
                                              effects and thus should be well understood by both modellers and
                                              policymakers. We emphasise that model assumptions should be transparent,
                                              results sought to be derived across a range of possible contexts, and

                                              end, co-design and co-production in research would support its relevance.

                                              is largely shaped by the combination of existing and new technologies,
                                              practices and behavioral patterns. We consider the findings relevant for
