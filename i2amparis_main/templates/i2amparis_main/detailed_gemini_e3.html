                              <p>
                                  GEMINI-E3 is a multi-country, multi-sector, recursive computable general equilibrium
                                  (CGE) model. It simulates all relevant markets, domestic and international, considered
                                  as perfectly competitive, which implies that the corresponding prices are flexible in
                                  markets for commodities (through relative prices), for labour (through wages), and
                                  for domestic and international savings (through rates of interest and exchange rates).
                                  Time periods are linked in the model through endogenous real rates of interest
                                  determined through the balancing of savings and investment. National and regional
                                  models are linked by endogenous real exchange rates resulting from constraints on
                                  foreign trade deficits or surpluses. There is one notable—and usual—exception to
                                  this general assumption of perfect competition, which concerns foreign trade.
                                  Goods of the same sector produced by the different countries are not supposed
                                  to be perfectly competitive; they are considered as economically different goods,
                                  more or less substitute according to an elasticity of substitution known as the
                                  Armington assumption. The main outputs of the GEMINI-E3 model are on a country
                                  and annual basis: carbon taxes, marginal abatement costs and prices of tradable
                                  permits (when relevant), effective abatement of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, net sales of tradable
                                  permits (when relevant), total net welfare loss and components (net loss from terms
                                  of trade, pure deadweight loss of taxation, and net purchases of tradable permits
                                  when relevant), macro-economic aggregates (e.g. production, imports and final demand),
                                  real exchange rates and real interest rates, and data at the industrial level (e.g.
                                  change in production and in factors of production, and prices of goods).

                                  Like other CGE models, GEMINI-E3 covers all economic activities. In this version,
                                  the model divides the economy into eleven sectors, each one of which produces a
                                  good. Five of the sectors are related to the energy sector, three represent the
                                  transport sector, one covers the energy-intensive industries, and the remaining
                                  two sectors are agriculture and other goods and services. Table 27 provides the

                                  The energy sectors are represented similarly to other economic sectors by using
                                  nested CES functions.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  For electricity production, GEMINI-E3 distinguishes fossil fuel (i.e. coal, natural
                                  gas and oil power plants), nuclear, hydro, solar and wind power plants. Power
                                  generation is separated from the other activities (transmission and distribution)
                                  that appear through their factors of production at the top of the nesting structure.
                                  Power generation involves only two factors of production: capital and fuel for fossil
                                  fuel power plants and capital and a resource for renewables. With this nesting
                                  structure it is possible to better take into account the power generation portfolio
                                  and to represent inter-fuel substitutability as well as substitutability between
                                  fossil and renewable power generation. The model allows the use of carbon capture and
                                  storage (CCS) technology for coal and gas power plants when the carbon price is above
                                  the full cost of CCS.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Coal, crude oil and natural gas sectors include a fixed factor that represents the
                                  non-renewable resource associated with each fossil fuel energy. For these sectors we
                                  suppose that the domestic production is realised with this fixed factor and the other
                                  standard inputs (i.e. capital, labour, material and energy) through, again, a nested
                                  CES function.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Finally, refined petroleum products are produced from the basic input, i.e. crude oil.
                                  The model considers this specificity with a CES function between crude oil and other
                                  standards inputs at the top level of the nested CES structure.

                                  GEMINI-E3 is a recursive-dynamic, yearly model, with backward-looking (adaptive)
                                  expectations. The model simulates the global economy up to 2050. The base year of the
                                  model is 2014.

                                  The building and calibration of the CGE model rest on economic and energy data that
                                  are usually contained in comprehensive databases, specially established for this
                                  purpose. In particular, this version of GEMINI-E3 is built on GTAP-10 (Aguiar et al.
                                  2019), a database that accommodates a consistent representation of energy markets in
                                  physical units (tons of oil equivalent) as well as detailed socio-accounting matrices
                                  in USD for a large set of countries or regions and bilateral trade flows. The GTAP
                                  database is completed by other information especially on indirect taxation and
                                  government expenditures, mainly coming from the International Energy Agency (IEA),
                                  OECD and the International Monetary Fund. Important efforts have been put into
                                  harmonising all these sources of information. The result is a consistent social
                                  accounting matrix for each country/region.

                                  Carbon emissions are directly computed from fossil energy consumption in physical
                                  quantities using coefficient factors that differ among firms (i.e. sectors),
                                  households and regions.

                                  The representation of non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is based on the GTAP
                                  Non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHG emissions (NCGG) dataset (Rose and Lee, 2008). The database
                                  distinguishes several emissions of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide
                                  (N<sub>2</sub>O) and fluorinated gases. The emissions of each source are linked to an
                                  activity level (or an economic driver). Abatements by gases are computed from the EPA
                                  abatement curves (EPA 2013).

                                  Forests can mitigate GHGs by storing carbon, therefore GEMINI-E3 computes carbon
                                  sequestered by forest. We use forest mitigation supply functions computed by Favero
                                  et al. (2018), which use the Global Timber Model (GTM) to simulate the optimal
                                  management of forest land for climate change mitigation under several carbon price
                                  paths. These supply curves allow to compute the carbon sequestered by forest in
                                  each region.

                                  As other global macroeconomic models, GEMINI-E3 determines endogenously all economic
                                  variables by sectors, regions and years. The model computes the level of production
                                  (and the inputs associated: labour, capital, energy, and materials) but also demand
                                  (household demand, investment and export) by sectors/goods and regions. The prices
                                  associated to each good are determined endogenously. However, the dynamic of the
                                  model in the baseline scenario is mainly driven by exogenous variables that are

                                  Population growth is exogenous and based on a forecast by the United Nations
                                  (United Nations 2019). The medium variant projection is usually retained. These
                                  projections allow to determine the growth of the labour supply using assumptions

                                  Economic growth (i.e. GDP growth) and international energy prices (i.e. crude oil
                                  price, natural gas and coal prices) are usually based on IEA’s forecasts in its World

                              GEMINI-E3 provides in a consistent way numerous economic variables at global and
                              national/regional levels. The first set of variables is related to macroeconomic
                              indicators such as:
                              <li>GDP</li>
                              <li>Households and government consumptions</li>

                                  These variables are expressed in volume (i.e. at the base year prices),
                                  but the prices associated to each of these macroeconomic aggregates are also computed
                                  (prices of GDP, of household consumption, etc.).
                              </p>
                              <p>

                              The second set refers to sectoral data:
                              <li>Production by sector</li>
                              <li>Demand by sector and by usage (final demand, intermediate use)</li>
                              <li>Production factors by sector (labour demand, energy consumption, capital, etc.</li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Again, for these sectoral data, changes in price and in volume are computed.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Finally, the model gives the international flows of goods and services (i.e.
                                  imports and exports) between the regions/countries described by the model.

                                  For each sector and region, the model computes total demand as the sum of final
                                  demand (investment, consumption and exports) and intermediate consumptions by all
                                  sectors. Then, demand is split between imports and domestic production according
                                  to the Armington assumption. Domestic production technologies are described through
                                  nested CES functions, which differ according to the sector. For example, Figure 17
                                  shows the nested CES production structure of the sector producing “other goods and
                                  services”. Production is done with four aggregates: capital, labour, material and
                                  energy. In a second step (nest), material and energy are decomposed in individual
                                  goods using again CES functions.

                                  Household behaviour consists of three interdependent decisions: 1) labour supply;
                                  2) savings; and 3) consumption of the various goods and services. In GEMINI-E3,
                                  both labour supply and the rate of savings are assumed to be exogenous. Demand
                                  in the different commodities has prices of consumption and income (more precisely
                                  "spent" income, i.e. income after savings) as arguments and is derived from nested
                                  CES utility functions, described in Figure 18. At the first level of the consumption
                                  function, households choose between three aggregates: housing, transport and other
                                  consumptions. Energy consumption is split into two parts: for transportation and
                                  housing purposes. Transport demand is split into purchased and own transports. The
                                  model distinguishes three types of personal vehicles depending on the fuel used.
                                  Electric vehicles (EV), which are mainly dedicated to short or medium distance, and
                                  two other types using the same motorisation (i.e. internal combustion, or IC), one
                                  using petroleum products and the other biofuels. Each vehicle is characterised by a
                                  vehicle capital (called powertrain in Figure 19) and a type of fuel used (refined oil,
                                  biofuel or electricity).

                                  Total government consumption is exogenous and its evolution over time, determined in
                                  the calibration of the model, is driven by the growth rates of the main aggregates of
                                  the economy. The model splits total consumption between goods based on fixed budget
                                  shares.

                                  The exports are the sum of imports by all other countries/regions that are
                                  endogenously determined in the model.

                                  Investment by products is derived from investment by sectors through a transfer
                                  matrix. Investment by sector is determined from an "anticipated" capital demand
                                  using the CES function of each sector. Anticipated production prices and demands
                                  are based on adaptive expectations.

                              GEMINI-E3 was mainly designed to assess climate change and energy policies. The model can
                              simulate climate change policies in two ways:
                                    <li>
                                        First, based on climate targets (or pathways) as the ones defined by COP21 (see
                                        Babonneau et al., 2018a), the model can evaluate the carbon prices that will be
                                        needed to reach these goals.
                                    </li>
                              <li>
                                  However, the model can also evaluate the impact on GHG emissions associated to a
                                  carbon tax defined by government (see Babonneau et al., 2018c).
                              </li>
                          </ol>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Climate change policies can be evaluated through the implementation of a carbon tax or
                                  an emissions trading system. The carbon tax can be uniform among countries/regions and
                                  sectors or be differentiated. The model can simulate a carbon tax framework coupled
                                  with an emissions trading system (see Babonneau et al., 2018b). Within these climate
                                  policies, other constraints such as nuclear moratorium or non-price policies (such as
                                  emission standards) can also be analysed (see Babonneau et al., 2018c).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Usually the carbon tax revenue is recycled by the government to households through a
                                  lump sum transfer in order to keep constant the surplus or deficit of the government.
                                  But other recycling rules can be implemented in the model.
                              </p>
                            <p>GEMINI-E3 computes not only the carbon prices associated to climate change policies but
                                also welfare changes. A consistent measure of welfare cost is the household’s surplus.
                                Deriving demand by households from a utility function then allows one to have a direct
                                economic measure of the welfare cost of abatement policies. Households surplus may be
                                directly reckoned from the numerical results of scenarios, for every year and every
                                country/region, and they can be aggregated in various ways: either weighted by exchange
                                rates and summed for a given year or period, or discounted through interest rates for a
                                given country and then measuring the total discounted cost of the abatement policy. To
                                eliminate the effects of changes in the relative prices of foreign trade, one must
                                subtract the marginal gain (or loss) from changes in the terms of trade (GTT) to
                                marginal welfare loss. This yields the so-called deadweight loss (DWL) of taxation.
                                The GTTs represent spill-over effects due to changes in international prices. In a
                                climate change policy, these GTTs come mainly from the drop in fossil energy prices
                                that result from the decrease of world energy demand.

                                  GEMINI-E3 was not originally designed to assess the sustainable development goals
                                  (SDGs). However, some indicators related to economic growth (SDG8), energy (SDG7) and
                                  climate (SDG13) can be evaluated directly from outputs of the model. Some other
                                  indicators may be analysed by performing some computations outside the model or by
                                  coupling GEMINI-E3 with other models.

                                              Results show that the EU burden-sharing based on GDP per capita implies
                                              very large discrepancies between Member States. If United Kingdom (UK)
                                              implements a Brexit, the 27 European countries could experience some
                                              welfare costs as additional abatements are required by the
                                              non-participation of UK to the ESD rules. In 2030, this additional cost is
                                              estimated at 8 billion € within a full Brexit. However, this cost is less
                                              significant than the one supported by UK which is approximately equal to
                                              15 billion € in 2030.
