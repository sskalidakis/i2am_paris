                                  42 is a simulation model for estimating CO2 emissions associated with energy
                                  consumption in a wide range of countries, dividing the world into 50 countries and
                                  regions. The key goal of the model is to describe the target characteristics of the
                                  perspective energy sector in different countries for their effective integration
                                  into the global process of regulating emissions. The model is used to calculate
                                  the impacts of possible structural changes, as well as of improvements in the
                                  efficiency of energy use. The energy sector of all countries is described in
                                  detail in the form of energy balances, synchronised with the methodology of the
                                  International Energy Agency (IEA). Modelling is based on a bottom-up approach:
                                  first, the final consumption of energy resources is estimated for the industrial,
                                  transport, residential, and services sectors; and then model calculates the necessary
                                  amount of primary energy resources needed to produce petroleum products, electricity
                                  and heat. Key influencing factors include changes in the fuel structure of electricity
                                  and heat production; changes in the efficiency of electricity and heat production
                                  based on different types of fuel; changes in the structure of vehicle fleet (for cars
                                  and trucks); changes in energy consumption per capita; and changes in energy
                                  efficiency in manufacturing sectors of the economy.

                                  42 requires a number of socioeconomic metrics, according to which both energy
                                  consumption and energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are modelled.
                                  The key parameters concern economic growth and its structure, population, vehicle

                                  Population growth is one of the primary causes of world energy consumption increase.
                                  The UN demographic forecast is usually employed as a basis for population scenarios.
                                  The reference (medium) scenario assumes an increase in the global population to 9.5
                                  billion by 2045 (average annual growth rate of 0.7%). 42 does not consider population
                                  structure (e.g. by age group, urbanisation status, etc.).

                                  Another driver for increasing energy consumption is economic growth. Currently,
                                  scenario hypotheses on the GDP growth rates for all the countries and regions under
                                  consideration are set in accordance with calculations on economic forecasting models
                                  performed by the team of the Institute of Economic Forecasting of the Russian Academy
                                  of Sciences. According to these estimates, global GDP will increase 2.45 times, from
                                  110 (currently) to 270 trillion dollars (2011 PPP) by 2045. However, 42 can use any
                                  hypotheses on GDP growth as inputs.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The structure of GDP is also an important metric, since different sectors are
                                  characterised by various levels of energy intensity. The 42 model distinguishes the
                                  following components of the total value added in the economy of all countries/regions:
                                  material production, transport, and services. The ratio of these segments is analysed
                                  basing on an econometric approach.

                              <p>
                                  Road transport is an important energy consumer, providing about 40% of global oil
                                  demand. The vehicle fleet size reflects the economic situation: the growth of
                                  household income stimulates the purchase of a private vehicle, and economic
                                  development creates a cargo flow for transportation. Further development of the
                                  world economy is associated with an increase of the fleet size. The reference scenario
                                  for the car fleet in Russia is defined as population times the automobilisation rate.
                                  At the same time, the automobilisation rate depends on GDP per capita (the
                                  relationship between these parameters is described by an S-shaped curve, which is
                                  similar to consumer demand saturation). However, its future dynamics can be
                                  significantly transformed. The modern generation of young people is less interested
                                  in buying a personal car, and new technologies make a sharing-based model of
                                  transportation affordable and convenient. The development of online services and
                                  remote work can also reduce the demand for mobility. Given these factors,
                                  transportation and fleet forecasts vary widely.

                                  Nowadays, the most crucial trend is government incentives to change the structure of
                                  the automotive market in the direction of low-carbon solutions (electric vehicles).
                                  Therefore, structural shifts in the fleet constitute another key socioeconomic
                                  metric for future energy consumption. Simulating the growth of the share of
                                  low-carbon transport is a way of modelling climate change mitigation.

                                  Economic and demographic development provide gross characteristics of energy demand.
                                  However, energy efficiency is superimposed on these, slowing the increase of global
                                  consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In the 42 model, there is no relationship
                                  between the investment process and energy efficiency. Instead, energy intensities
                                  of different industries are inputs to the model.

                                  The logarithmic approximation is used as typical dynamics of energy intensity curves
                                  in different industries. It is characterised by damping dynamics and is well suited
                                  to describe the logic of energy consumption process evolution. The growing logarithmic
                                  curve produces a situation of increasing consumption, as it implies that the role of
                                  an energy resource is strengthened in a specific economic sector (for instance,
                                  electrification of residences and services; increase in electric equipment in
                                  industries of developing countries; spread of carbon-free resources in developed
                                  countries). The falling logarithmic curve produces situations either of improving
                                  the efficiency or of consumers moving away from a particular energy source (for
                                  instance, a replacement of coal).

                                  Modelling is based on a bottom-up approach: first, the final consumption of energy
                                  resources is estimated for industry, transport, the residential sector, and services;
                                  and then the model calculates the necessary amount of primary energy resources needed
                                  to produce petroleum products, electricity and heat. The amount of primary energy
                                  consumption in these two phases explains the total energy consumption, which is
                                  multiplied by the carbon intensity vector and thus CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
                                  associated with
                                  the energy sector are calculated.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The process of energy consumption is modelled as a combination of three classes of
                                  influencing factors:
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Consumption = Gross factor * Structural factor * Technological factor
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                              Gross factor characterises the size of an object consuming energy. The examples of such
                              factors distinguished are as follows:
                              <li>GDP (gross factor for the entire economy)</li>
                              <li>population (gross factor for residential sector)</li>
                              <li>vehicle fleet (gross factor of transport sector)</li>
                              <li>electricity production (gross factor of power sector)</li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                              The structural factor is necessary in order to identify which part of the “gross” object
                              consumes a particular energy product. The following structural factors are distinguished:
                              <li>GDP structure (shares of value added in material production, transport and services
                                  in relation to GDP)</li>
                              <li>
                                  electricity production structure (it determines how much electricity will be
                                  generated on the basis of different types of energy resources)
                              </li>
                              <li>vehicle fleet structure (it shows how many cars will consume different types of
                                  motor fuels)</li>
                          </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <ul>
                                      The technological factor is necessary in order to describe the dynamics of
                              specific energy consumption. For example, how much natural gas is needed to produce 1 kWh
                              of electricity; how many litres of diesel are needed to drive 100 km by car; how much
                              energy is needed to create 1 million USD of value added in the services. The following
                              technological factors are distinguished:
                              <li>vehicle fuel efficiency per 100 km</li>
                              <li>efficiencies of power generation technologies</li>
                              <li>energy intensity of value added in different s</li>
                                  </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Using all these key drivers of future energy demand as model inputs, the 42 is
                                  focused on energy-associated CO2 emissions calculation according to a simulation-based
                                  approach.

                              Model 42 offers a simulation-based description of energy consumption processes. Therefore,
                              in addition to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, it requires parameters of
                              CO2 mitigation measures in terms of structural and technological features of the energy
                              sector. A list of key parameters for all countries under consideration is given below:
                              <li>vehicle fleet and its structure (depending on the people’s mobility hypothesis);</li>
                              <li>structure of electricity and heat production (may be based on the countries’ goals
                                  within the framework of the Paris Agreement or more ambitious targets);</li>
                              <li>energy intensities of different sectors;</li>
                              <li>fuel efficiency for cars and trucks (may be based on countries technical regulation
                                  of automotive industry and markets); and</li>
                              <li>fuel efficiency for electricity and heat plants.</li>
                          </ul>

                              <p>
                                  These parameters should be set to take into account existing goals of the national
                                  climate policy implemented by the countries under consideration, as well as to define
                                  the most efficient structure of the energy sector that is in line with the goals of
                                  the selected level of climate change mitigation (be that the Paris Agreement goals or
                                  scenarios of increased ambition).

                              As a simulation model, 42 predominantly works by adjusting the structural characteristic
                              and efficiency parameters of energy-consuming sectors. In addition, the emission limits
                              being adopted by countries may be used as a simulation target. The following policies
                              can be implemented during the calculations:
                              <li>goals for renewable energy-based electricity generation in benchmark years;</li>
                              <li>restrictions of the capacities/production for the power plants based on the fossil
                                  fuels;</li>
                              <li>restriction or complete ban on sale and use of conventional (internal combustion
                                  engine) cars;</li>
                              <li>stimulation of energy efficiency in terms of decreasing energy intensities of value
                                  added and energy consumption per capita; and</li>
                              <li>restriction of CO2 emissions associated with energy consumption.</li>
                          </ul>

                                  42 may help to implement policy-relevant investigations, focused on searching the
                                  objective parameters, which are consistent with a low-carbon future, of national
                                  energy sectors of a wide list of countries. The overarching question the model aims to
                                  address is: <i>what is the structure of the energy balance, in consistency with the
                                  Paris Agreement?</i>
