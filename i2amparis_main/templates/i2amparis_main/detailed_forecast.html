                                reduce CO2 emissions, combined with a high level of technological detail. It is based on
                                a bottom-up modelling approach considering the dynamics of technologies and
                                socioeconomic
                                drivers. Technology diffusion and stock turnover are explicitly considered to allow
                                insights into transition pathways. The model further aims to integrate different energy
                                efficiency and decarbonisation policy options and allows to address research questions
                                related to energy demand including the analysis of scenarios for future demand of
                                individual energy carriers like electricity or natural gas, calculating energy saving
                                potentials and impact on GHG emissions as well as abatement cost curves, ex-ante policy
                                impact assessments and the investigation of long-term sustainable energy transition
                                scenarios (Fleiter et al., 2018 and Herbst et al., 2017).

                                The FORECAST platform comprises <b>three individual modules</b> (see the figure below), each
                                representing one sector according to the Eurostat energy balances: <b>industry,
                                services/tertiary and residential</b>. While all sector modules follow a similar
                                bottom-up methodology, they also consider the particularities of each sector like
                                technology structure, heterogeneity of actors and data availability.

                                The list of selected <b>input data</b> provides an idea of the level of detail of each
                                module. Each sector requires sector specific <b>activity data</b>, like industrial
                                production in the industry sector, number of employees in the services sector
                                and number of households in the residential sector. These can either be retrieved
                                from external sources or derived within the macroeconomic module of FORECAST,
                                based on available GDP and population projections from other models or studies.
                                Furthermore, end-consumer <b>energy prices</b> play an important role in each sector and
                                are distinguished by energy carrier (e.g. electricity, coal, oil, natural gas,
                                biomass and district heating). These too can either be retrieved from external
                                sources or derived within the macroeconomic module of FORECAST based on available
                                wholesale price projections for electricity, coal, oil, and natural gas. The third
                                group of input data, the <b>technology characterisation</b> also reflects data
                                availability of the individual sectors. While in the industry and tertiary sector
                                the model works with so-called energy-efficiency measures (EEMs), which represent
                                all kinds of actions that reduce energy consumption, in the residential sector
                                the stock of alternative appliances and the market share of different efficiency
                                classes is explicitly modelled. In all cases, energy savings can be calculated and
                                traced back to technological dynamics including cost considerations.

                                The model system has been developed for the <b>EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland</b>,
                                but has
                                also been applied in international studies for Turkey, Brazil and Taiwan
                                (Bastos et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2016 and Elsland et al., 2014). The model delivers
                                <b>annual results</b> at <b>country-level up to 2050</b>.

                                A list of technologies considered in the model is provided in the following table, showing its high
                                level of technological detail. FORECAST considers all major tertiary and household
                                appliances and a large variety of different heating technologies for buildings
                                (also by sub-sector). In the industry sector, in addition to the differentiation
                                by sub-sector and energy carrier, the most important energy-intensive products are
                                implemented in the model and further differentiated by production process. Depending
                                on data availability, processes can consist of small individual production steps
                                (e.g. burning of clinker in the cement industry) or entire production lines for
                                individual products or product groups (e.g. bricks, ceramic tiles).

                                The tertiary model distinguishes eight sub-sectors (trade, hotel and restaurants,
                                traffic and data
                                transmission, finance, health, education, public administration and other) and various
                                end-uses as
                                shown in the previous table. To derive future energy demand, an annual energy service driver is
                                multiplied by
                                the annual specific energy demand per unit of driver. For example, the electricity
                                demand for space
                                cooling can be calculated using the specific energy demand per m² floor area cooled and
                                the quantity
                                of the given driver, here the share of cooled floor area per employee. This is in turn
                                driven by
                                employment in the tertiary subsectors. The diffusion of energy efficiency measures
                                depends on the
                                cost-effectiveness of efficiency alternatives or efficiency add-on measures (see section
                                3.4; for
                                more details see Jakob et al. (2012) and Jakob et al., 2013).

                                The residential model separates household energy demand into four sub-groups (appliances
                                and lighting,
                                sanitary hot water, space heating, new and others), which are reflected by various
                                end-uses
                                (see previous table). The end-uses are further broken down into technologies, and each
                                technology is
                                distinguished by various efficiency classes. The calculation of energy demand in the
                                residential
                                sector is structured as follows: the majority of final residential energy demand is
                                attributed to
                                space heating. The useful heat demand is calculated in a first step based on a detailed
                                representation
                                of the European building stock. The model is designed as a vintage stock model that
                                captures the
                                number of end-uses in the market in combination with their age distribution. For heating
                                systems,
                                the vintage stock is represented by market shares. Technology diffusion depends on the
                                relative cost
                                advantages of substitution alternatives. The cheaper an alternative is, the larger its
                                market share
                                in the corresponding year (for details see Elsland, 2016).

                                The bottom-up approach, which distinguishes individual technologies, allows modelling
                                the diffusion
                                of technologies as the result of individual investment decisions taken over time. For
                                all types of
                                investment decisions, the model follows a simulation approach rather than optimisation
                                in order to
                                better capture the real-life behaviour of companies and households.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whenever possible, the investment decision is modelled as a discrete choice process,
                                where households
                                or companies choose among alternative technologies to satisfy a certain energy service.
                                It is
                                implemented as a logit approach considering the total cost of ownership (TCO) of an
                                investment plus
                                other intangible costs. This approach ensures that even if one technology choice is more
                                cost-effective than others, it will not gain a 100% market share. This effect reflects
                                heterogeneity in the market, niche markets and non-rational behaviour of companies and
                                households,
                                which is a central capability to model policies. Still, the resulting technology
                                development
                                (and energy demand) is price sensitive.

                                The replacement of equipment/buildings/technologies is based on a vintage stock approach
                                allowing to
                                realistically model the replacement of the capital stock considering its age
                                distribution. Some parts
                                of the industrial and the tertiary sector are not using a vintage stock approach, due to
                                the huge

                                Modelling energy-efficiency policies is a core feature of the FORECAST model. The
                                simulation algorithm
                                and the vintage stock approach are well suited to simulate most types of policies.

                                <i> Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS)</i>, e.g. for appliances or buildings,
                                can easily be
                                modelled by restricting the market share of new appliances starting in the year the

                                <i>Energy taxes</i> for end-consumers can be modelled explicitly on the basis of more
                                than ten
                                individual energy carriers (electricity, light fuel oil, heavy fuel oil, natural gas,
                                lignite,

                                <i>Information-based policies</i> are generally the most complicated to model due to
                                their rather
                                “qualitative character”. The discrete-choice approach, however, allows to consider such
                                qualitative
                                factors. For example, labelling of appliances resulting from the EU Labelling Directive
                                can be
                                modelled by adjusting the logit parameters and thus assuming a less heterogeneous
                                market, in which
                                a higher share of consumers select the appliance with the lowest total cost of
                                ownership. See for
                                example (Elsland et al., 2013).

                                <i>EU emissions trading</i> can be modelled in the form of a CO2 price for

                                industries. The detailed technology disaggregation in the industrial sector considering
                                more
                                than 80 individual products and processes allows to consider the scope of the EU ETS on
                                a very
                                detailed level. A combined discrete choice and technology vintage model simulates the

                                            All scenarios show that an ambitious improvement in energy efficiency
                                            can reduce the costs of decarbonisation and make substantial contributions
                                            to CO2 savings over the next 10 to 20 years in particular. However, that
                                            alone is not enough to reduce emissions sufficiently. A decisive factor is
                                            the rapid expansion of renewable energies in order to generate CO2-free
                                            electricity. This is particularly important because electricity consumption
                                            in the industrial sector could rise sharply by 2050 - doubling or even
                                            tripling depending on the scenario. This would happen above all if
                                            electricity were increasingly used for process heat generation and
                                            important processes in the chemical and steel industries were converted to
                                            electrolysis hydrogen. A 95 percent reduction in greenhouse gases and thus
                                            almost CO2-neutral industrial production by 2050 requires fundamental
                                            changes along the value chain. These include the spread of low-CO2 cement
                                            types, efficient use of materials and a comprehensive recycling economy.
                                            The capture and storage of CO2 can also play a role, for example in
                                            reducing remaining emissions during the production of cement clinker and
                                            lime

                                            Decarbonising heating and cooling requires energy efficiency on both
                                            demand and supply sides of the heat sector. Heat savings can
                                            cost-effectively reduce the total heat demand in Europe by
                                            approximately 30-50%. District heating can capture excess heat, which
                                            is currently being wasted, and can replace fossil energy sources to heat
                                            EU cities. Based on cost and energy considerations, district heating
                                            should increase from today’s level of 10% up to 50% by 2050. Large heat
