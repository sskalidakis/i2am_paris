                              <ul>

                              <p>TEEM incorporates the following features:</p>
                              <p><b>1) Wholesale electricity market modelling (BSAM):</b></p>
                              <p>
                                  Modeling of the day-ahead market by solving the Security Constrained Unit Commitment
                                  and Economic Dispatch problems. System constraints (e.g., supply equals demand,
                                  satisfaction of reserves requirements), operating plants constraints (e.g., minimum
                                  and maximum generation, uptime and downtime requirements), system reserves, price
                                  caps, etc., are considered in simulations. Agents (e.g., thermal generators, imports
                                  and hydroelectric generators) within the wholesale electricity market are modelled as
                                  entities aiming in profit maximisation, while the market is cleared with objective
                                  function being the minimization of electricity generation costs. Thus BSAM simulates
                                  a competitive electricity market.
                              </p>
                              <p><b>2) Technology adoption considering behavioural uncertainty (ATOM)</b></p>
                              <p>
                                  Simulation of technology adoption under policy schemes of interest, quantifing
                                  uncertainties related to agents’ preferences and decision-making criteria. The
                                  novelty of the model lies in obtaining realistic uncertainty bounds and splitting the
                                  output uncertainty in its major contributing sources. A calibration module defines
                                  the parameters influencing the agents’ behavior, and suitable ranges of values
                                  according to historical data and observations are defined. A sensitivity analysis

                                  DREEM is a fully integrated dynamic high-resolution model resolving key features that
                                  are not found together in existing Demand-Side Management (DSM) models. The model
                                  serves as an entry point in DSM modeling in the building sector, by expanding the
                                  computational capabilities of existing Building Energy System (BES) models to assess
                                  the benefits and limitations of demand-flexibility, primarily for consumers, and for
                                  other power actors involved. DREEM is a hybrid bottom up model that combines the key
                                  features of both statistical and engineering models. The novelty of the DREEM model
                                  lies mainly in its modularity, as its structure is decomposed into individual modules
                                  characterized by the main principles of component- and modular-based system modeling
                                  approach, namely "the interdependence" of decisions within modules.

                              <p><b>BSAM</b> is built upon the notion that agents aim to maximize their profits within a
                                  competitive market aiming to minimize the total electricity generation costs. Agents
                                  interact with each other within the wholesale electricity market by placing bids for
                                  their electricity generation. Agents' profits are calculated by considering a profit
                                  margin above marginal costs for electricity generation. Agent profit bids decisions
                                  are continuously updated based on knowledge and information acquired from previous bid
                                  decisions. An optimization of the Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch problem
                                  minimizes the total electricity generation costs. To do so, a ranking of agent price
                                  bids in an increasing order is followed by an iterative process of clearing
                                  electricity-price bids under the constraint that supply should equal demand. After
                                  meeting the demand requirements the process stops and the SMP and the total system
                                  cost are calculated. </p>
                              <p>The core principle of <b>ATOM</b> is that of agent-based modelling. In particular, each
                                  agent has a private initial belief about the expected annual cash inflows from
                                  investing in a PV system. This belief is expressed as a Gaussian distribution.
                                  Furthermore, to capture the effects of social learning, each agent receives
                                  information from the agents in its social circle that have already invested in a PV
                                  system. This information concerns the actual profitability of their investments so
                                  far, and is used to update the agent’s beliefs. This is equivalent to updating a
                                  Gaussian prior, given a new observation. Accordingly, each agent has a social circle.
                                  This condition is modeled as a “small-world” network, which is a type of mathematical
                                  graph.</p>

                                  generators (i.e., lignite- and gas-fueled plants). This additional cost increases the

                                                  stands, is not capable of achieving the necessary capacity addition
                                                  towards the Greek target of 2025. In particular, while the scheme
                                                  could be successful until the end of 2021, it won’t be able to reach
                                                  the national target of 2025, even in the most optimistic scenarios.
                                                  The effectiveness of the net-metering scheme in Greece is closely
                                                  related to the retail price of electricity. Simulation results
                                                  indicated that an increase in the retail price, reduces the total
                                                  uncertainty in the modeling outcomes, which is mainly introduced by
                                                  modeling parameters, as the probability of investing, consumers’
                                                  beliefs and resistance towards investing. In policy terms, this is
                                                  translated into a reduction of the behavioural uncertainty related to
                                                  the effectiveness of the NEM scheme, especially for the case of
                                                  risk-averse consumers, which implies that different sources of

                                              Net-metering is capable of driving adequate investments in small-scale PV
                                              that follow the Greek PV targets’ trajectory only in the short term. This
                                              is because grid charges for net-metered electricity burden the prosumers
                                              instead of being used to increase the value of locally generated
                                              electricity for their benefit. Thus, bill savings (i.e., prosumers’
                                              profits) are solely dependent on the electricity retail price, which
                                              reduces consumers’ willingness to install a photovoltaic system. A
                                              self-consumption scheme that subsidizes battery storage showed great
                                              potential to incentivise investments y consumers. This is because,
                                              with a self-consumption scheme prosumers consume more self-generated
                                              electricity since it can be stored for later direct use. Furthermore,
                                              grid charges are paid only for the electricity
                                              consumed from the grid. As such, there is less price-related uncertainty
                                              and prosumers’ profits are higher. However, stepwise reduction of subsidy
                                              is suggested, to ensure an initial uptake of PV, wihle avoiding excessive
                                              subsidies' cost. Regarding the applicability of AIM, the study showed that
                                              while 100% success of a policy pathway, regardless the contextual
                                              evolution, cannot be achieved, opportunities and dead-ends can be
                                              highlighted and visualized in a stakeholder-friendly fashion.
