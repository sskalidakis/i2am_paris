                                LEAP, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System, is a widely-used
                                scenario-based software tool, which supports a wide range of different modelling
                                methodologies for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment
                                at many different scales, ranging from cities and states to national, regional and
                                global applications. On the demand side, these applications range from bottom-up
                                end-use accounting techniques to top-down macroeconomic modelling. LEAP’s
                                functionalities lay within the core activities of countries undertaking integrated
                                resource planning, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation assessments, and Low Emission
                                Development Strategies (LEDS), especially in the developing world. The main purpose
                                of LEAP lies in providing a means of comparison between a “Business as Usual (BaU)”
                                scenario, and other user-customised scenarios promoting the adoption of innovative
                                policies and sustainable strategies in the context of a country, in crucial activity
                                sectors, such as the energy production and the building envelope. LEAP supports
                                numerous scenarios, thus providing for in-depth insights regarding a wide variety
                                of key energy, environmental and socioeconomic indicators. At least 32 countries
                                used LEAP for a variety of tasks focused on the field of GHG mitigation by several
                                techniques, such as changing the energy consumption on the demand side, shifting
                                the energy carrier on the supply side and imposing policies on the supply and demand
                                sides (Martı́nez-Jaramillo et al., 2017) in the context of creating energy and
                                emissions scenarios, to be the basis for their Intended Nationally Determined
                                Contributions (INDCs) to climate action. (Dagher and Ruble, 2011) constructed
                                LEAP-based scenarios and examined the technical, economic, and environmental
                                implications of all scenarios with regard to electrical planning. Using the
                                LEAP model, Jun and Lee (2010) focused on the penetration of renewable energies
                                on the existing electricity generation market in South Korea, in terms of economic
                                and environmental influence. (Cai et al., 2007) assessed the reduction potential of
                                CO2 emissions in China’s electricity sector and simulated different development paths.

                                LEAP is based on an integrated, scenario-based structure, which can also be used to
                                track energy consumption, production and resource extraction in all sectors of an
                                economy, including accounting for GHG emission sources and sinks at both the energy
                                and non-energy sectors. LEAP’s structure enhances the representation of the energy
                                system of each Member State by breaking down the energy used in each economic
                                activity, even to the “lowest” level (i.e. households). It also allows for the
                                modelling of several energy production units (e.g. lignite, natural gas, renewables,
                                etc.) along with their technical specifications (e.g. power, technical minimum,
                                lifetime, fuel, etc.) as well as optimised unit commitment, in terms of meeting the
                                end-user demand curve with the minimum cost. Energy CO2 emissions and other
                                greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2 from others sources, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6)
                                are then calculated by the model, with respect to the energy production side.
                                In addition to tracking GHG emissions, LEAP can also be used to analyse emissions
                                of local and regional air pollutants, and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs),
                                making it well-suited to studies of the climate co-benefits of local air pollution
                                reduction. Given LEAP’s diversity, it can be used to explore GHG mitigation
                                alternatives through energy system transformations as well as to provide policy
                                insights towards transitioning to a climate-resilient energy sector.

                                On the demand side, each sector is modelled as a production or an energy intensity level
                                and the use
                                of other key intermediate factors (capital, intermediate consumptions, etc.) given its
                                expectations
                                on demands and prices. Regarding the end-user side specifically, the final demand is
                                usually broken
                                down into four major categories: a) residential, b) agricultural, c) commercial and d)
                                transport,
                                providing the user with the capacity to introduce all associated information, such as
                                (non-)
                                electrified households, passenger- and ton-km, etc. As we move further from the demand
                                side, LEAP
                                allows the user to model the energy production side, along with their respective
                                networks and
                                implications (e.g. resource limitations and energy losses). This approach can be used to
                                fully
                                describe individual policy measures which can then be combined in different combinations
                                and
                                permutations into alternative integrated scenarios, thus allowing policy makers to
                                assess the impact
                                of an individual policy as well as the interactions that occur when multiple policies
                                and
                                measures are combined, in terms of both energy and environmental impact.

                                LEAP is intended as a medium- to long-term modelling tool. Its calculations occur based
                                on a
                                user-defined time-step (e.g. annual, 5-year period, etc.) and baseline year (e.g. 2005,
                                2010, etc.),
                                and the time horizon can extend to an unlimited number of years (beyond 2100). Studies
                                typically
                                include both a historical period known as the Current Accounts, in which the model is
                                run to test
                                its ability to replicate known statistical data, as well as multiple forward-looking
                                scenarios.
                                Typically, most studies use a forecast period of between 20 and 50 years.

                                Some results are calculated with a finer level of temporal detail. For example, the year
                                can
                                be split into different user-defined “time slices” to represent seasons, types of days
                                or even
                                representative times of the day. These slices can be used to examine how loads vary
                                within the
                                year and how electric power plants are dispatched differently in different seasons. LEAP
                                includes an
                                easily-customised dataset of time-slices, which extends from seasonal segregation (i.e.
                                summer,
                                winter, autumn, fall) today- and night- time of all seasons as well as hourly
                                representation.
                                This kind of in-depth time-slicing seeks to provide analytical insights and partially

                                and the
                                fluctuating end-user demand across the year, by facilitating the matching of supply and
                                demand in
                                each time-slice.

                                The climate component in LEAP includes a diverse database of both energy and
                                non-energy sector GHG emissions per fuel or activity, thus calculating the
                                final GHG emissions stemming from an energy system’s operation at global,
                                national, regional, or local level, based on the initial energy and
                                socioeconomic data provided (e.g. demographics, income, GDP, etc.).
                                The tool tracks far beyond the three main sources of greenhouse gases
                                (i.e. CO2, CH4, and N2O), extending its analysis to tracking SLCFs such as
                                fluorinated gases, black carbon, etc. The LEAP model also includes the
                                Technology and Environmental Database (TED), which provides extensive
                                information describing the technical characteristics, costs and environmental
                                impacts of a wide range of energy technologies (including existing technologies,
                                current best practices and next generation devices), compiled from numerous
                                sources (e.g. Eurostat, EEA, etc.). Thus, LEAP is appropriate for energy policy
                                analysis and climate change mitigation assessment. Since LEAP is a scenario-based
                                modelling tool, its climate module calculates changes in the atmospheric
                                concentration of all implicated GHG emissions between a reference scenario (which
                                depicts the current condition of a system in terms of energy—demand and supply—and
                                demographics—population, income, etc.) and a number of GHG mitigation-oriented
                                scenarios based on current and future limitations, aligned with the ongoing global
                                treaties and agreements (such as the goals set by the Paris Agreement or by
                                increasing ambition).

                                LEAP requires in-depth inputs regarding the changes in socioeconomic conditions
                                (e.g. population, household size, etc.) and energy sector (e.g. supply and demand),
                                as well as demand for other goods and services that affect GHG emissions
                                (such as agricultural demand) for both the reference and the mitigation scenarios,
                                over the time horizon of the analysis. It should be noted that LEAP does not
                                include a default set of socioeconomic and energy data, since it is an
                                easily-customised tool that can be adjusted to use several socioeconomic
                                and sectoral growth projections from different sources (aside from SSPs). Since
                                the economic, population and sectoral growths are used to capture specific drivers
                                for the changes in energy demand in a reference scenario (in which no climate
                                change mitigation measure has been applied), LEAP allows users to self-assess and
                                define the sets of energy service demands over the horizon, as well as to
                                quantify them based on a diverse set of quantification units. This set of
                                quantification varies from passenger-kms and tonne-kms in the transport sector
                                to kWhs and metric tonnes in the industrial sector, as well as to Gigajoules of
                                final consumption per unit of activity level (GJ/€). LEAP is
                                also widely open to conducting cost-benefit analyses if the required socioeconomic
                                and energy inputs needed are partially available.

                                LEAP is calibrated for the initial period, in terms of fuels, based on a
                                standard fuels database drawing data from IEA, UN and other standard international
                                sources (such as the IPCC). These data sources should suffice for most LEAP analyses.
                                However, LEAP allows the user to edit the default data, for example to change the
                                energy contents of certain fuels (such as coal and wood) to reflect the conditions
                                in the area they aim to study. In addition, LEAP provides an “Add” and “Delete”
                                button for the user to add a new fuel and delete one respectively, if necessary,
                                and manually define its respective specifications. Regarding the projections for
                                energy in the reference and mitigation scenarios, the installed technological
                                capacity along with its CAPEX and OPEX, the exported, imported, produced and
                                consumed quantities for all energy carriers etc., LEAP does not include a
                                respective database, and therefore this kind of data must be entered and updated
                                manually.

                                Thus, for each economic activity, the energy demand is broken down in key
                                categories such as oil, gas, solid fuel, biomass, etc. Regarding the electricity
                                sector, LEAP allows for an in-depth representation of the energy mix capability
                                by providing several energy-based production units such as, solar, nuclear, wind,
                                etc. By simulating the substitution of low-carbon for high-carbon technologies
                                in response to their relative costs, as well as emissions constraints, the LEAP
                                model simulates mitigation. The principal energy sector CO2 mitigation technology
                                options are as shown in the following table. The plethora of energy choices that LEAP provides
                                can be crucial for the suggestion of several mitigation/adaptation policies.
                                These scenarios may aim to the reduction of GHG emissions or the abatement of
                                the cost of energy production. An interesting example is the choice between
                                hydroelectric power and nuclear power. Both energy sources are emission-free
                                but each of them features different costs depending on the region they are applied.

                                LEAP simultaneously calculates the quantity of the energy produced, converted and
                                consumed with regard to the different “commodities” accounted for in the model,
                                the total GHG emissions stemming from a system’s operation, as well as the way in
                                which these emissions are broken down into each sector, in a given region or economy
                                under a range of alternative assumptions on population, economic development,
                                technology, prices and so on. These commodities comprise the different energy forms,
                                the deployed technologies, and the energy services. LEAP allows to reach a
                                cost-minimising level of commodity production and consumption, consistent
                                with meeting all current and future energy demands and emissions constraints.
                                The total energy system cost is calculated as a Net Present Value (NPV) cost of
                                the energy system over the entire pre-defined time horizon. With its flexible data
                                structures, LEAP allows for analysis as rich—in technological specification and
                                end-use detail—as the user chooses. All of the aforementioned features contribute
                                to the creation and evaluation of multiple alternative mitigation scenarios.
                                These scenarios can be compared with a reference scenario (which projects the
                                progress of energy demand, energy production, social costs and GHGs emissions of
                                the region studied if no significant changes occur on the current energy system),
                                in order to evaluate the contingent reduction of GHG emissions or social costs
                                of the different mitigation scenarios suggested.

                                LEAP can be used to project the energy supply and demand situation in order to get
                                a glimpse of future patterns, identify potential problems, and assess the likely
                                impacts of energy policies. In this respect, LEAP allows to examine a wide variety
                                of projects, programs, technologies and other energy initiatives, and arrive at
                                strategies that best address environmental and energy problems. Some
                                indicative policies that can be implemented in LEAP are the following:

                                    (e.g. to simulate minimum or maximum desired levels of operation);

                                    Constraints on the CO2-related primary energy resources exploited (e.g.
                                    limit the availability of fossil fuels down to its minimum in the upcoming years);

                                    vehicles, based on cleaner fuels with lower consumption, such as CNG);

                                    over time and which policies are the most effective, in terms of both minimising
                                    costs and maximising social benefits?

                                LEAP does not automatically calculate the implications on non-climate SDGs of its
                                least-cost energy system to
                                meet prescribed climate or emissions constraints. However, it is possible to exploit
                                LEAP’s outputs
                                and conduct “off-model” calculations to estimate many of the SDG implications. For
                                example, LEAP
                                reports the total final energy consumption in an energy system. This energy can be
                                reshaped at lower/higher
                                levels, depending on the successful implementation of different mitigation scenarios,
                                thus allowing
                                for an estimation of the energy-poor citizens.
