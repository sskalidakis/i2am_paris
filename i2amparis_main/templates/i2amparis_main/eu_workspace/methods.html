        As part of the PARIS REINFORCE research project, a regional workshop took place on November 21, 2019, in
        Brussels, Belgium For the co-production of research underpinning new climate
        policy in Europe.
        Stakeholders were invited based on their displayed participation or interest in previous
        European climate policy events, resulting in a sample of over 800 invitations. During the workshop, high-level
        staff of the EC directorates-general (DGs) for energy, climate and research, ministries and climate-related
        governmental bodies from EU Member States, international organisations, business representatives, and scientists
        participated.

        The consultation, along with an open crowd-sourcing process carried out
        via an online polling platform 24 h before the event, resulted in a list of 22 topics, which were broken down
        into 3 thematic groups.

        57 individuals attended the workshop physically, although the event was also livestreamed to allow
        as large and diversified an audience as possible.

        Given the range of proposed questions, participants were given the option to vote (via sli.do1) on and
        prioritise which questions they would be most interested in discussing. After topic selection, the floor was
        open for discussion between chairs and audience. Chairs spent 1â€“2 min introducing the discussion on each topic,
        and then stakeholders were able to raise any points or questions they had over the proposed research areas.
        Following the discussion, sli.do voting again allowed stakeholders to vote according to how relevant they see it
        for the project to follow up on and conduct research in each topic. The process is illustrated below.
