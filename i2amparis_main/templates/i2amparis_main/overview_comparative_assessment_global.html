                                                ensemble is an asset
                                                and, in order to make efficient use of the available models, we
                                                must inform on their
                                                potential uses for climate policy support. Evidently, not all
                                                questions can be equally
                                                addressed by all models, nor will all models that can address a
                                                specific question give
                                                similar answers. The policy issues to be addressed by the models
                                                are mainly related to
                                                mitigation of and adaptation to climate change, although all eight
                                                models are better
                                                suited for studying mitigation options than they are for delving
                                                into adaptation; as

                                                This section begins with the presentation of the main drivers, or
                                                exogenous variables,
                                                such as socioeconomic assumptions, that are considered essential
                                                inputs for the
                                                modelling simulations. Once defined, the mechanisms involved in
                                                each model in the
                                                climate action scenarios are defined. After considering these
                                                drivers and mechanisms,
                                                we take stock of policy instruments that can be implemented in
                                                each model either
                                                directly or after specific modelling adjustments. Finally, we
                                                provide a short overview
                                                of how a transition pathway is calculated as well as of example
                                                use cases for each
                                                model. A detailed account of the information included in this

                                                present here the
                                                main drivers and exogenous assumptions necessary for the modelling
                                                simulations.
                                                This includes GDP and population growth on the one hand, which are
                                                the core
                                                socioeconomic pillars of integrated assessment modelling input and
                                                usually based
                                                on universal socioeconomic databases like the Shared Socioeconomic

                                                framework (Riahi et al., 2017), and other key parameters on the
                                                other, which
                                                largely vary among the models.

                                            <p>
                                                Regarding the former, all eight models require inputs on
                                                population projections.

                                                options included in the eight models, as detailed in Tables 3 to
                                                6.

                                            <p>
                                                Upstream technologies like hydrogen production and synthetic fuel
                                                production are covered in detail as mitigation options in MUSE, which
                                                covers
                                                almost all existing technologies. GCAM and TIAM only include coal
                                                and biomass to liquids production, with and without carbon capture
                                                and storage/sequestration (CCS); but, like MUSE, both models include
                                                most hydrogen production technologies. GCAM however additionally
                                                features thermal
                                                splitting but not biomass to hydrogen (with CCS). It should be
                                                noted that E3ME also includes a limited number of upstream
                                                technologies but not to the same detail as the other three models.

                                                With the exception of DICE, all models cover a large set of
                                                mitigation options in the electricity generation sectors, ranging
                                                from nuclear to renewables: CCS, hydro, solar photovoltaic (PV)
                                                and concentrating solar power (CSP), onshore and offshore wind
                                                turbines, biomass (with and without CCS) and geothermal; the
                                                general equilibrium models (GEMINI-E3 and ICES), however, feature
                                                less technological detail, while contrary to most other models 42
                                                also includes nuclear fusion (along with TIAM) and do
                                                not distinguish onshore and offshore wind. Regarding heat
                                                generation, only 42, MUSE and TIAM feature significant detail,
                                                while GCAM includes heat from biomass.

                                                In the building sector, the energy system (42 and MUSE) and
                                                partial equilibrium (GCAM and TIAM) models include mitigation
                                                options to lesser or larger extent; while GEMINI-E3 includes
                                                building technologies as an aggregated parameter; and ICES only
                                                covers behavioural changes and electricity for cooling as
                                                exogenous shifts in households’ energy demand.

                                                In the transport sector, GCAM, TIAM, MUSE and 42 again cover all
                                                or almost all technologies for road transportation, while
                                                GEMINI-E3 only includes fully electric vehicles. The technological
                                                options for GHG emission reductions in aviation and shipping are
                                                relatively limited, and only in the four abovementioned models,
                                                covering biofuels (GCAM, TIAM, MUSE, 42), hydrogen (TIAM),
                                                electricity (MUSE) and efficiency (TIAM, 42) in aviation; and gas
                                                (MUSE, TIAM, 42), hydrogen (TIAM, MUSE), biofuel (all four) and
                                                efficiency (42) in shipping. Railways electrification is also
                                                available in all four models (and GEMINI-E3), while MUSE also
                                                includes hydrogen fuel cell rail. Finally, modal shift can be used
                                                to favour low-carbon transports in GCAM and GEMINI-E3, which two
                                                along with ICES also include behavioural changes in the transport
                                                sector.

                                                For the manufacturing sectors, GCAM, TIAM, MUSE and 42 include
                                                various mitigation options for heat processing, machine drives,
                                                steam, combined heat and power (CHP); while GEMINI-E3 covers some
                                                of them as an aggregate. In addition, MUSE also includes CCS
                                                options in industry, as is the case for TIAM as well, which
                                                however also includes direct air capture (DAC).

                                                To mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture, MUSE, 42, TIAM and
                                                GEMINI-E3 cover energy use in detail, whereas GCAM includes
                                                mitigation options for land yield maximisation and improved
                                                feeding. GCAM, GEMINI-E3 and ICES also cover behavioural change
                                                mitigation options, such as reductions in demand.

                                                In land use, land-use change and forestry, the available
                                                mitigation options in the modelling ensemble are afforestation
                                                (GCAM, TIAM and MUSE), land protection (GCAM and MUSE) and
                                                biomaterials (GCAM).

                                                The models documented in this deliverable do not in general
                                                produce outputs that are directly relevant to adaptation
                                                considerations but can offer indirect insights to inform
                                                adaptation planning. The GCAM model has some consideration of
                                                adaptation, directly allowing the set-aside of protected land, as
                                                well as directly calculating the additional cooling requirement of
                                                buildings as the climate warms, while ICES covers restrictions to
                                                water use.

                                                In principle, adaptation measures could be included as a
                                                consideration in all models’ simulations of mitigation pathways,
                                                through for example limiting bioenergy resources (e.g. to
                                                represent adaptation to crop yield reductions in a warming
                                                climate), or increasing building cooling requirements exogenously
                                                given the expectation of a warmer climate. However, these models
                                                do not project the impacts of a changing climate, so they are of
                                                limited use for adaptation considerations.

                                                All of the models are able to report on emissions and therefore on
                                                climate action (SDG13). All models can also offer direct insights
                                                into affordable and clean energy (SDG7), with the exception of
                                                DICE: this entails analyses of renewable energy (all models),
                                                access to electricity and primary energy intensity (ICES),
                                                traditional biomass use (42 and GCAM), and a full assessment of
                                                energy commodities (TIAM, E3ME and MUSE). The same can be said for
                                                industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9), with the exception
                                                of GCAM and 42 that do not feature direct implications. Decent
                                                work and economic growth (SDG8) is also covered by five models,
                                                mainly via GDP (per capita) growth and employment impacts. SDG2
                                                (zero hunger) is also included in half of the models, be looking
                                                into food prices (GCAM, GEMINI-E3 and E3ME) and overall
                                                undernourishment (ICES).

                                                Regarding ICES, a dedicated module aims at offering a
                                                comprehensive assessment of future sustainability up to 2030 (with
                                                the capacity to extend the analysis to 2050) based upon 27
                                                indicators related to the seventeen SDGs, under different
                                                socioeconomic and policy scenarios, by combining the ICES
                                                modelling framework with a regression approach (based on
                                                historical data) to offer an internally-consistent set-up for
                                                analysing future patterns of sustainability indicators and their
                                                inter-linkages.
