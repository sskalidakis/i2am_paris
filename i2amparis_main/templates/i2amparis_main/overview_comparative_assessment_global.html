                                                ensemble is an asset
                                                and, in order to make efficient use of the available models, we
                                                must inform on their
                                                potential uses for climate policy support. Evidently, not all
                                                questions can be equally
                                                addressed by all models, nor will all models that can address a
                                                specific question give
                                                similar answers. The policy issues to be addressed by the models
                                                are mainly related to
                                                mitigation of and adaptation to climate change, although all eight
                                                models are better
                                                suited for studying mitigation options than they are for delving
                                                into adaptation; as
                                                well as to overall sustainable development.

                                                This section begins with the presentation of the main drivers, or
                                                exogenous variables,
                                                such as socioeconomic assumptions, that are considered essential
                                                inputs for the
                                                modelling simulations. Once defined, the mechanisms involved in
                                                each model in the
                                                climate action scenarios are defined. After considering these
                                                drivers and mechanisms,
                                                we take stock of policy instruments that can be implemented in
                                                each model either
                                                directly or after specific modelling adjustments. Finally, we
                                                provide a short overview
                                                of how a transition pathway is calculated as well as of example
                                                use cases for each

                                                Regarding the former, all eight models require inputs on
                                                population projections.
                                                This is the case for GDP growth, with the exception of the general
                                                equilibrium
                                                models (DICE, as an optimal growth model, included), which

                                                macroeconomic indicators, such as consumption, trade, employment,

                                                As far as other key parameters are concerned, these vary greatly

                                                due to their mathematical and economic structure. For example,

                                                equilibrium models like GEMINI-E3 and ICES require detailed
                                                information on
                                                national and international social accounting matrices, government
                                                transactions and
                                                other flows, which are used for calibrating the models and usually
                                                draw from
                                                specific databases. But what all models have in common, beside

                                                options included in the eight models, as detailed in the following tables.

                                                Upstream technologies like hydrogen production and synthetic fuel
                                                production are covered in detail as mitigation options in MUSE, which
                                                covers
                                                almost all existing technologies. GCAM and TIAM only include coal
                                                and biomass to liquids production, with and without carbon capture
                                                and storage/sequestration (CCS); but, like MUSE, both models include
                                                most hydrogen production technologies. GCAM however additionally
                                                features thermal
                                                splitting but not biomass to hydrogen (with CCS). It should be
                                                noted that E3ME also includes a limited number of upstream
                                                technologies but not to the same detail as the other three models.

                                                With the exception of DICE, all models cover a large set of
                                                mitigation options in the electricity generation sectors, ranging
                                                from nuclear to renewables: CCS, hydro, solar photovoltaic (PV)
                                                and concentrating solar power (CSP), onshore and offshore wind
                                                turbines, biomass (with and without CCS) and geothermal; the
                                                general equilibrium models (GEMINI-E3 and ICES), however, feature
                                                less technological detail, while contrary to most other models 42
                                                also includes nuclear fusion (along with TIAM) and do
                                                not distinguish onshore and offshore wind. Regarding heat
                                                generation, only 42, MUSE and TIAM feature significant detail,
                                                while GCAM includes heat from biomass.

                                                In the building sector, the energy system (42 and MUSE) and
                                                partial equilibrium (GCAM and TIAM) models include mitigation
                                                options to lesser or larger extent; while GEMINI-E3 includes
                                                building technologies as an aggregated parameter; and ICES only
                                                covers behavioural changes and electricity for cooling as
                                                exogenous shifts in households’ energy demand.

                                                In the transport sector, GCAM, TIAM, MUSE and 42 again cover all
                                                or almost all technologies for road transportation, while
                                                GEMINI-E3 only includes fully electric vehicles. The technological
                                                options for GHG emission reductions in aviation and shipping are
                                                relatively limited, and only in the four abovementioned models,
                                                covering biofuels (GCAM, TIAM, MUSE, 42), hydrogen (TIAM),
                                                electricity (MUSE) and efficiency (TIAM, 42) in aviation; and gas
                                                (MUSE, TIAM, 42), hydrogen (TIAM, MUSE), biofuel (all four) and
                                                efficiency (42) in shipping. Railways electrification is also
                                                available in all four models (and GEMINI-E3), while MUSE also
                                                includes hydrogen fuel cell rail. Finally, modal shift can be used
                                                to favour low-carbon transports in GCAM and GEMINI-E3, which two
                                                along with ICES also include behavioural changes in the transport
                                                sector.

                                                For the manufacturing sectors, GCAM, TIAM, MUSE and 42 include
                                                various mitigation options for heat processing, machine drives,
                                                steam, combined heat and power (CHP); while GEMINI-E3 covers some
                                                of them as an aggregate. In addition, MUSE also includes CCS
                                                options in industry, as is the case for TIAM as well, which
                                                however also includes direct air capture (DAC).

                                                To mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture, MUSE, 42, TIAM and
                                                GEMINI-E3 cover energy use in detail, whereas GCAM includes
                                                mitigation options for land yield maximisation and improved
                                                feeding. GCAM, GEMINI-E3 and ICES also cover behavioural change
                                                mitigation options, such as reductions in demand.

                                                In land use, land-use change and forestry, the available
                                                mitigation options in the modelling ensemble are afforestation
                                                (GCAM, TIAM and MUSE), land protection (GCAM and MUSE) and
                                                biomaterials (GCAM).

                                                The models documented in this deliverable do not in general
                                                produce outputs that are directly relevant to adaptation
                                                considerations but can offer indirect insights to inform
                                                adaptation planning. The GCAM model has some consideration of
                                                adaptation, directly allowing the set-aside of protected land, as
                                                well as directly calculating the additional cooling requirement of
                                                buildings as the climate warms, while ICES covers restrictions to
                                                water use.

                                                In principle, adaptation measures could be included as a
                                                consideration in all models’ simulations of mitigation pathways,
                                                through for example limiting bioenergy resources (e.g. to
                                                represent adaptation to crop yield reductions in a warming
                                                climate), or increasing building cooling requirements exogenously
                                                given the expectation of a warmer climate. However, these models
                                                do not project the impacts of a changing climate, so they are of
                                                limited use for adaptation considerations.

                                                partnership for sustainable development is excluded, as out of the
                                                scope of the featured modelling tools. Among these SDGs and with
                                                the exception of ICES which can provide insights into all SDGs,
                                                the other seven models can deliver indicators to track directly or
                                                indirectly eleven of the SDGs.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                All of the models are able to report on emissions and therefore on
                                                climate action (SDG13). All models can also offer direct insights
                                                into affordable and clean energy (SDG7), with the exception of
                                                DICE: this entails analyses of renewable energy (all models),
                                                access to electricity and primary energy intensity (ICES),
                                                traditional biomass use (42 and GCAM), and a full assessment of
                                                energy commodities (TIAM, E3ME and MUSE). The same can be said for
                                                industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9), with the exception
                                                of GCAM and 42 that do not feature direct implications. Decent
                                                work and economic growth (SDG8) is also covered by five models,
                                                mainly via GDP (per capita) growth and employment impacts. SDG2
                                                (zero hunger) is also included in half of the models, be looking
                                                into food prices (GCAM, GEMINI-E3 and E3ME) and overall
                                                undernourishment (ICES).

                                                Other covered SDGs include SDG1 on poverty prevalence (ICES); SDG3
                                                on health through physical density and life expectancy (ICES) and
                                                pollution levels linked to mortality (GCAM, TIAM and E3ME); SDG4
                                                on literacy rate (ICES); SDG5 on gender inequality based on income
                                                distribution (E3ME); SDG6 on water and sanitation via freshwater
                                                withdrawals (ICES) and groundwater depletion (GCAM); SDG10 on
                                                inequalities (E3ME and ICES); SDG11 on sustainable cities (ICES);
                                                SDG12 on responsible production and consumption through material
                                                productivity (ICES), and footprint impacts (GCAM); SDG15 on life
                                                on forest land (ICES and GCAM) and land use change (GCAM); and
                                                SDG16 on peace, justice and institution (ICES).

                                                Regarding ICES, a dedicated module aims at offering a
                                                comprehensive assessment of future sustainability up to 2030 (with
                                                the capacity to extend the analysis to 2050) based upon 27
                                                indicators related to the seventeen SDGs, under different
                                                socioeconomic and policy scenarios, by combining the ICES
                                                modelling framework with a regression approach (based on
                                                historical data) to offer an internally-consistent set-up for
                                                analysing future patterns of sustainability indicators and their
                                                inter-linkages.

                                                Regarding the use of global integrated assessment models, a legitimate
                                                question has been raised, both in the literature and in the policy
                                                world, around the levels of trust that people (whether scientists,
                                                policymakers, or other stakeholders) should have in these models and
                                                their outputs (Doukas and Nikas, 2020). That is, especially, considering
                                                the underlying assumptions driving them (Kelly and Kolstad, 1999) and
                                                uncertainty ranges (Doukas et al., 2018), as well as the extent to which
                                                these are communicated alongside the results.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                It is unavoidable that models, such as those documented in I2AM PARIS,
                                                cannot provide a complete representation of the world, owing to the fact
                                                that in many ways the future is unknown, and furthermore there is
                                                incomplete knowledge of past dynamics governing energy, agricultural,
                                                land and environmental systems that are represented by these models.

                                            <p>
                                                Despite this challenge, these models are intended to be trusted, and
                                                seen as useful and valid, by both the scientific community and—equally
                                                if not more importantly—stakeholders such as policy- and
                                                decision-makers, who will plan low-carbon strategies on their basis.
                                                Here we briefly detail the steps that have been applied in developing
                                                and using the models, as well those that will be applied in the context
                                                of the PARIS REINFORCE project, in order that such trust and validation
                                                is achieved.

                                                In particular, very early in the project the consortium has put
                                                significant effort in documenting each of the employed models’
                                                capabilities, in terms of geographic disaggregation, sectoral
                                                representation, types of greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions
                                                accounted for, technological detail, policy representation,
                                                socioeconomic inputs and outputs, and representation of metrics relevant
                                                to non-climate SDG indicators. It has done so for every global model in
                                                the consortium, (a) in detailed and technical format for experts’
                                                consideration (see <a href="http://paris-reinforce.epu.ntua.gr/detailed_model_doc/gemini_e3">here</a>), (b) in a dynamic interface and easy-to-digest
                                                language for non-experts to comprehend and map their requirements onto
                                                (see <a href="http://paris-reinforce.epu.ntua.gr/dynamic_doc/42/?format=_alternative_3">here</a>), and (c) in a comparative setting, allowing all stakeholders
                                                to understand which models should be employed for which policy questions
                                                (as in this page). As part of this step, the project released and shared
                                                with stakeholders a policy brief on ‘what can our models do?’ (<a href="https://paris-reinforce.eu/sites/default/files/2019-11/PARIS REINFORCE Policy Brief What our models can do.pdf">link</a>).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Secondly, as with national/regional models for the EU and
                                                countries/regions outside the EU, the global modelling approach is in
                                                line with the “prolonged nature of model validation” (Barlas, 1996).
                                                This approach integrates opinions from the scientific community with the
                                                perspectives of stakeholders and external experts that will ultimately
                                                use the model results. PARIS REINFORCE will, in this respect, undertake
                                                active engagement with global stakeholders aimed at communicating what
                                                the models are, as well as what they can do, including a presentation of
                                                the modelling approach, preliminary results, and a discussion of the
                                                types of inputs and outputs the models produce and how they do this.
                                                This interaction will therefore provide an opportunity to place our
                                                models’ results in the context of previous results from other global
                                                low-carbon pathways modelling activities. They will also allow the
                                                project, not only to clearly communicate the modelling capabilities,
                                                features, and questions they have been asked to address in the past, but
                                                also to co-create the most pertinent questions stakeholders would like
                                                the models to address in the context of PARIS REINFORCE, in light of
                                                this well-informed stakeholder perspective. The project workflow
                                                involves first undertaking global, regionally-disaggregated modelling to
                                                explore the regional dynamics of emissions and energy/agricultural and
                                                land system transitions globally, before discussing the realism,
                                                feasibility and validity of such results with both global and regional
                                                stakeholders. In this way, global models can undertake scenarios
                                                informed by national stakeholders in various regions around the world,
                                                improving the real-world relevance of their outputs.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Third, a central aspect of achieving real-world relevance is to
                                                undertake basic harmonisation/benchmarking of the models, via targeted
                                                validity checks. This includes ensuring that base-year emissions,
                                                socio-economic assumptions, policies, and energy/agricultural/land
                                                system representations are in line with the most up-to-date verified
                                                information, and that such inputs are to the extent possible harmonised
                                                across the models used in a multi-model analysis; this is not to strip
                                                models of their invaluable diversity in the way they behave in response
                                                to specific stimuli as well as the theoretical foundations underpinning
                                                them, but quite the contrary to allow the consortium to later map the
                                                resulting ranges onto this diversity rather than uncertainties
                                                associated with ad hoc inputs assumed for each model. This also includes
                                                technology costs and performance variables. The underlying detailed
                                                protocol for achieving this has been documented in Giarola et al.

                                                Fourth, “diagnostic” tests are and will be run for each model, to check
                                                that its responses to key input variable changes, such as stringency of
                                                climate policy (as represented by emissions targets, carbon prices, or
                                                combinations thereof), are in line with common expectations and compared
                                                to other results and models covering the same/similar regions and/or a
                                                priori defined stylised behaviours. For global models, this includes
                                                comparing the resulting ranges of the inter-comparison exercises to
                                                those of similar studies in the scientific or grey literature; for
                                                example, in building a robust reference scenario looking at current
                                                policy efforts (Sognnaes et al.), comparisons have been drawn against
                                                recent similar scientific endeavours like (Roelfsema et al., 2020) or
                                                high-impact reports like the International Energy Agency’s 2019 World
                                                Energy Outlook (IEA, 2019). These checks will build on the normal
                                                standard practice undertaken by each modelling group to regularly check
                                                the model code and ensure that errors/bugs are identified and
                                                eliminated, and to report the model’s performance alongside its results.

                                                Finally, this evaluation process will be carried out in an iterative
                                                process throughout the project. It will be documented to ensure that
                                                models perform without unexplained dynamics in both reference and
                                                mitigation cases. A key element of this will be in taking documented
                                                modelling results back to stakeholders in the second half of the
                                                project, when they will be able to understand the behaviours of the
                                                models under increasingly stringent mitigation scenarios, and to ask why
                                                the models respond in the way that they do.

                                                In combination, these evaluation steps cover the primary elements of the
                                                workflow suggested by Schwanitz (2013) on model validation. The models’
                                                conceptual framework has to a large extent already been evaluated (and
                                                will be clearly communicated with stakeholders) as following from a
                                                principle of identifying least-cost pathways to low-carbon futures given
                                                the technological other input assumptions (like technology constraints,
                                                socio-economic dynamics, and representations of policies). The I2AM
                                                PARIS platform is intended to represent a major advance in communicating
                                                in a clear, accessible and attractive way the features, objectives,
                                                coverage, capabilities and limitations of models. Such documentation has
                                                been and will be accompanying our stakeholder interactions. Model
                                                structure and responses are being tested through both diagnostics as
                                                well as comparisons with other published low-carbon and reference case
                                                pathways. Whilst most modelling groups explicitly draw on a vast range
                                                of literature and comparative studies to understand the extent to which
                                                their results are similar to or different from others, and if so why, in
                                                PARIS REINFORCE we will explicitly undertake and present such
                                                comparisons throughout our modelling, to help better build trust in the
                                                results and the models themselves.
