                            <p>The Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) is a global integrated
                                assessment model that represents both human and Earth system dynamics.
                                It explores the behaviour and interactions between the energy system,
                                agriculture and land use, the economy and climate. The role of GCAM is
                                to bring multiple human and physical Earth systems together in one
                                place to provide scientific insights that would not be available from
                                the exploration of individual scientific research lines. The model
                                components provide a faithful representation of the best current
                                scientific understanding of underlying behaviour.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                GCAM allows users to explore what-if scenarios, quantifying the
                                implications of possible future conditions. These outputs are not
                                predictions of the future; they are a way of analysing the potential
                                impacts of different assumptions about future conditions. GCAM reads
                                in external “scenario assumptions” about key drivers (e.g.,
                                population, economic activity, technology, and policies) and then
                                assesses the implications of these assumptions on key scientific or
                                decision-relevant outcomes (e.g., commodity prices, energy use, land
                                use, water use, emissions, and concentrations).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is used to explore and map the implications of uncertainty in key
                                input assumptions and parameters into implied distributions of
                                outputs, such as GHG emissions, energy use, energy prices, and trade
                                patterns. Techniques include scenarios analysis, sensitivity analysis,
                                and Monte Carlo simulations.
                            </p>

                                GCAM has been used to produce scenarios for national and international
                                assessments ranging from the very first IPCC scenarios (Response
                                Strategies Working Group, 1990) through the present Shared
                                Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (Calvin et al., 2017).

                            <p>GCAM takes in a set of assumptions and then processes those assumptions
                                to create a full scenario of prices, energy and other transformations,
                                and commodity and other flows across regions and into the future. The
                                energy, agriculture and land use, economy and climate systems are
                                interconnected and interact with each other (see the figure below). The
                                interactions between these different systems are modelled as one
                                integrated whole.

                                energy transformation, final energy carriers and end-use (see the figure below). It also tracks
                                international trade in energy commodities. All the different elements of GCAM interact
                                through market prices and physical flows of, for example, electricity.

                            <p>Within each of the land regions shown in the second figure, land is categorised into
                                approximately a dozen types based on cover and use. In GCAM, competing uses of land
                                are nested within land nodes. Within each land node, it is generally assumed to be
                                easier to substitute products. Among arable land types, further divisions are made for
                                lands historically in non-commercial uses (forests and grasslands) and commercial land
                                uses (commercial forests and croplands). Production of approximately twenty crops is
                                currently modelled, with specific yields depending on the land region and management
                                type (with and without irrigation, high and low fertiliser).

                            <p>GCAM uses a global climate carbon-cycle climate module, Hector (Calvin et al., 2019),
                                an open-source, object-oriented, reduced-form global climate carbon-cycle model that
                                represents the most critical global-scale earth system processes. At every time step,
                                emissions from GCAM are passed to Hector. Hector converts these emissions
                                to concentrations and calculates the associated radiative forcing and the response of
                                the climate system (e.g., temperature, carbon-fluxes, etc.).

                            <p>Hector has a three-part main carbon cycle: a one-pool atmosphere, three-pool land, and
                                four-pool ocean (see the figure below). The atmosphere consists of one well-mixed box. The ocean
                                consists of four boxes, with advection and water mass exchange simulating circulation.
                                The high-latitude surface ocean takes up carbon from the atmosphere, while the
                                low-latitude surface ocean off-gases carbon to the atmosphere. The land consists of a
                                user-defined number of biomes or regions for vegetation, detritus and soil. The
                                vegetation takes up carbon from the atmosphere while the detritus and soil release
                                carbon back into the atmosphere. The earth pool is continually debited with each time
                                step to act as a mass balance check on the carbon system. Hector actively solves the
                                inorganic carbon system in the surface ocean, directly calculating air– sea fluxes of
                                carbon and ocean pH. It reproduces the global historical trends of atmospheric [CO2],
                                radiative forcing, and surface temperatures.</p>

                            <p>The socioeconomic components of GCAM set the scale of economic activity and associated
                                demands for model simulations. Assumptions about population and per capita GDP growth
                                for each of the 32 geo-political regions together determine the GDP. Population and
                                economic activity are used in GCAM to transfer information to other GCAM components,
                                and are determined exogenously.

                            <p>GCAM’s inputs include information on population and the rate of per capita income

                                about population and per capita GDP growth for future time periods, for example those
                                of the SSPs. The macro-economic module takes both of these to produce overall GDP in
                                each GCAM energy-economic region, where the regional GDP is calculated using a simple

                                Growth in industrial sectors is based on a pre-defined GDP elasticity which decreases
                                over time, thus assuming saturation of industrial demand with rising incomes. The
                                values of these elasticities vary per region and between different SSPs. Apart from a
                                GDP elasticity, industrial demand also depends on an assumed price elasticity for
                                industrial energy use.

                            <p>Per capita demand for passenger transport depends on an assumed GDP per capita
                                elasticity and price elasticity, which means that more transport services are demanded
                                at higher incomes and cheaper transport. However, there is also a time cost involved
                                in transport, which increases proportionally with GDP per capita, and which is summed
                                to the capital and energy costs of transport. This means that, at higher incomes,
                                demand for passenger transport slowly saturates due to the price elasticity multiplied
                                by the increasing costs of time. Also, demand shifts to faster ways of transport, for
                                which time costs are lower. Demand for freight transport, like for industrial sectors,
                                depends on an assumed GDP elasticity and price elasticity.

                                products are equal to 0 throughout the future, which means that these basic needs will
                                be fulfilled, independent of commodity prices. Demand for animal products depends on
                                the price of such products, as well as incomes, and assumptions in income elasticities
                                vary strongly between different SSPs.

                            <p>GCAM is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and low-carbon
                                technologies that are envisaged to be available for at least the first half of the
                                21st century. By simulating the substitution of low-carbon for high-carbon
                                technologies in response to their relative costs, as well as emissions constraints
                                and/or carbon prices, the GCAM model simulates mitigation through a large set of
                                different measures (see model template).

                            <p>The core operating principle for GCAM is that of market equilibrium. The representative
                                agents in the modules use information on prices and make decisions about the
                                allocation of resources. They represent, for example, regional electricity sectors,
                                regional refining sectors, regional energy demand sectors, and land users who have to
                                allocate land among competing crops within any given land region. Markets are the
                                means by which these representative agents interact with one another. Agents indicate
                                their intended supply and/or demand for goods and services in the markets. GCAM solves
                                for a set of market prices so that supplies and demands are balanced in all these
                                markets across the model (see the figure below); in other words, market equilibrium is assumed to
                                take place in each one of these markets (partial equilibrium), and not in the entire
                                economy across all markets (general equilibrium). The GCAM solution process is the
                                process of iterating on market prices until this equilibrium is reached. Markets exist
                                for physical flows such as electricity or agricultural commodities, but they also can
                                exist for other types of goods and services, for example tradable carbon permits.
                            </p>
                            <p>As an example, in any single model period, GCAM derives a demand for natural gas
                                starting with all of the uses to which natural gas might be put, such as passenger and
                                freight transport, power generation, hydrogen production, heating, cooling and
                                cooking, fertiliser production, and other industrial energy uses. Those demands depend
                                on the external assumptions about, for example, electricity generating technology
                                efficiencies, but also on the price of all of the commodities in the model. GCAM then
                                calculates the amount of natural gas that suppliers would like to supply given their
                                available technology for extracting resources and the market price. The model gathers
                                this same information for all of the commodities and then adjusts prices so that in
                                every market during that period supplies of everything from rice to solar power match
                                demands.</p>

                            <p>GCAM is a dynamic recursive model, meaning that decision-makers do not know the future
                                when making a decision today, as opposed to other optimisation models, which assume
                                that agents know the future with certainty when they make decisions. After it solves
                                each period, the model then uses the resulting state of the world, including the
                                consequences of decisions made in that period—such as resource depletion, capital
                                stock retirements and installations, and changes to the landscape—and then moves to
                                the next time step and performs the same exercise. The GCAM version used is typically
                                operated in five-year time steps with 2100 as the final calibration year. However, the
                                model has flexibility to be operated at a different time horizon through user-defined
                                parameters.</p>
                            <p>While the agents in the GCAM model are assumed to act towards maximising their own
                                self-interest, the model as a whole is not performing an optimisation calculation. In
                                fact, actors in GCAM can make decisions that “seemed like a good idea at the time”,
                                but which are not optimal from a larger social perspective and which the decision
                                maker would not have made had the decision maker known what lay ahead in the future.
                                For example, the model’s actors do not know about future climate regulations, and
                                could install fossil fuel power in the years preceding the implementation of such
                                policies. Also, stated preferences by agents for certain technologies (e.g. transport
                                modes) are calculated in the base year and such preferences are persistent into the
                                future (their evolution can be changed by the user), preventing the solution to be
                                completely cost-minimising or profit-maximising.</p>

                            <p>One of GCAM’s uses is to explore the implications of different future policies. There
                                are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:

                            <p>One of GCAM’s uses is to explore the implications of different future policies. There
                                are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Emissions-related policies:</b> There are three main policy approaches that can be
                                applied in GCAM to reduce emissions of CO2 or other GHGs: carbon/GHG prices, emissions
                                constraints, or climate constraints. In all cases, GCAM implements the policy approach
                                by placing a price on emissions. This price then filters down through all systems in
                                GCAM and alters production and demand. For example, a price on carbon would put a cost
                                on emitting fossil fuels. This cost would then influence the cost of producing
                                electricity from fossil-fired power plants that emit CO2, which would then influence
                                their relative cost compared to other electricity generating technologies and increase
                                the price of electricity. The increased price of electricity would then make its way
                                to consumers that use electricity, decreasing its competitiveness relative to other
                                fuels and leading to a decrease in electricity demand.</p>
                            <p>• Carbon or GHG prices: GCAM users can directly specify the price of carbon or GHG
                                emissions. Given a carbon price, the resulting emissions will vary depending on other
                                scenario drivers, such as population, GDP, resources, and technology.
                                • Emissions constraints: GCAM users can specify the total amount of (CO2 or other GHG)
                                emissions as well. GCAM will then calculate the price of carbon needed to reach the
                                constraint in each period of the constraint.
                                • Climate constraints: GCAM users can specify a climate variable (e.g. concentration
                                or radiative forcing) target for a particular year. Users determine whether that
                                target can be exceeded prior to the target year. GCAM will adjust carbon prices in
                                order to find the least-cost path to reaching the target.
                            </p>
                            <p>Emissions prices of different GHGs can be linked together for a multi-gas policy.
                                Additionally, markets in GCAM can be set for any emission species (e.g., CH4-only
                                market, NOx market, etc.). In addition to identifying emission prices as one measure
                                of cost, GCAM employs the “deadweight loss” approach to measuring welfare loss from
                                emissions mitigation efforts through carbon pricing.</p>
                            <p><b>Energy production policies: </b>There are times when users would like to explore the
                                implications of a constraint on production or a minimum production requirement. This
                                capability allows GCAM users to model policies such as renewable portfolio standards
                                and biofuels standards. Across sectors, these constraints must be applied as quantity
                                constraints, but they can be applied as share constraints within individual sectors
                                (e.g. fraction of electricity that comes from solar power). In implementing these
                                policies, users can set either a lower bound or an upper bound. The model will solve
                                for the tax (upper bound) or subsidy (lower bound) required to reach the given
                                constraint.</p>
                            <p><b>Land use policies</b></p>
                            <p>• Protected Lands: With this policy, GCAM users can set aside a fraction of natural
                                land, removing it from economic competition. This land cannot be converted to crops,
                                pasture, or any other land type. This is similar to real-world policies such as
                                reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).
                                • Valuing carbon in land: When applying a price on carbon through any of the
                                emissions-related policy approaches, GCAM users can choose whether that price extends
                                to land use change CO2 emissions. This policy is modelled as a subsidy to land-owners
                                for holding carbon stocks as opposed to a price on the emissions themselves.
                                • Bioenergy constraints: GCAM users can impose constraints on bioenergy within GCAM.
                                Under such a policy, GCAM will calculate the tax or subsidy required to ensure that
                                the constraint is met.

                                it is possible to use its outputs and calculate the predictions for certain indicators
                                framed in the SDG agenda.

                                            cost ranged from 1.4 to 2.45, depending on the scenario. At the regional

                            <p>In GCAM-China, the 31 Chinese provinces are included as explicit regions that operate
                                within the global GCAM model. Energy transformation (electricity
                                generation and refined liquids production) and end-use demands (buildings,
                                transportation, and industry) are modelled at the individual province level, and
                                inter-province trade of all energy goods is considered. For electricity trade between
                                provinces, provinces are grouped into 6 grid regions. Whereby provinces
                                within the same sub-region can trade freely within that sub-region, trade between
                                regions may be limited. The following table shows an overview of features calibrated at the
                                country, grid and province level. The model can generate pathways through to 2100 with
                                5 year time periods.
                            </p>
                            <p>The more detailed province-level approach for China has advantages over the global
                                version of GCAM, in terms of more detailed assumptions on socioeconomic and energy
                                futures, resulting into potentially more realistic reference scenarios. Also, the
                                higher geographical granularity as advantages for policy analysis and impacts of
                                climate policies might differ strongly between provinces.

                                are predominantly IEA energy balances for energy production and consumption, and
                                FAOSTAT balances for food demand and agriculture. For province- and grid-level data in
                                China, national Chinese data sources have been used for calibration.

                                            The inclusion of new provincial CO2 storage cost curves gives a more
                                            detailed evaluation of where,
                                            in terms of geography and sector, and when CCUS deployment in China may take
                                            place. The results
                                            suggest that the scale of deployment varies depending on socioeconomic
                                            development pathways and the
                                            level of deployment of other low-carbon technologies. Across provinces and
                                            development pathways,
                                            early deployment of CCUS occurs within industrial and synthetic fuel
                                            production sectors, followed by
                                            increased deployment in the power sector by mid-century. Several provinces,
                                            such as Shandong, Inner
                                            Mongolia, Hebei, and Henan, emerge as particularly important in CCUS
                                            deployment, as a result of
                                            large CO2 point sources and storage availability. Results indicate that
                                            storage resource
                                            availability is unlikely to constrain CCUS deployment in most provinces
                                            through the end of the
                                            century.

                                GCAM-SOUSEI, like the GCAM model from which it is derived, is a multi-region global
                                model, which includes Japan as a separate region. The level of energy system,
                                agriculture and land use detail for the Japan region allows it to be used to study
                                Japan’s national-level low-carbon pathways. In addition, GCAM-SOUSEI uses emission
                                pathways that account for uncertainties in a number of climate-relevant parameters
                                relating CO2 atmospheric concentrations to global temperature changes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These emission pathways are obtained from a large set of experimental results with a
                                climate model (Earth system model of intermediate complexity, or EMIC) covering a
                                wider range of parameters and uncertainties than the original GCAM model, leading to
                                a range of CO2 emissions being associated with each temperature change target.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The climate model in GCAM-SOUSEI emulates the Earth system, covering the range of
                                values of physical and biogeochemical parameters indicated by multiple Earth System
                                Models (ESMs), which are highly complex and detailed models used to analyse the global
                                changes of the atmosphere, the land and the ocean (the original GCAM model includes a
                                simple climate model called the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced
                                Climate Change, or MAGICC).

                                The emission pathways for allowable carbon emissions translate into lower total energy
                                consumption, shift from high shares of fossil fuels to larger shares of renewables and
                                nuclear energy, as well as the increase in CCS penetration. Also, larger amounts of
                                bioenergy crops result in conversion of unmanaged land (pastures, arable land among
                                others) into land for bioenergy crops.

                                The GCAM model was expanded to include greater spatial detail in the USA region,
                                referred to as GCAM-USA. GCAM-USA is built within the GCAM framework. Hence
                                assumptions in GCAM-USA are made in the same way as the rest of the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In GCAM-USA, the 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia (hereafter, the 51
                                states) are included as explicit regions that operate within the global GCAM model. Energy transformation (electricity generation and refined
                                liquids production) and end-use demands (buildings, transportation, and industry) are
                                modelled at the individual state level, and inter-state trade of all energy goods is
                                considered. For electricity trade between states, states are grouped into the 13 NEMS
                                Electricity Market Module Regions (EIA 2010), plus Alaska and Hawaii.
                                Whereby states within the same sub-region can trade freely within that sub-region,
                                trade between regions may be limited. Also, prices for final energy commodities
                                (except for biomass products) are calibrated per grid region, reflecting regional
                                differences in energy prices. The following table shows an overview of features calibrated at
                                the country, grid and state level.

                                The more detailed state-level approach for the USA has advantages over the global GCAM
                                model, in terms of more detailed assumptions on socioeconomic and energy futures,
                                resulting into potentially more realistic reference scenarios. Also, the higher
                                geographical granularity has advantages for policy analysis, as climate policies often
                                vary by state in the USA, and impacts of climate policies might differ strongly
                                between states.

                                The GCAM model is calibrated for its base year, 2010. For international and USA-wide
                                data, the same data sources are used for calibration as for the global model, which are
                                predominantly IEA energy balances for energy production and consumption, and FAOSTAT
                                balances for food demand and agriculture. For state- and grid-level data in the USA, the State Energy Data System from the EIA (2014) is used as the
                                primary dataset. Socioeconomic data are calibrated for 2015 at the state-level,
                                reflecting data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

                                Outcomes in GCAM depend strongly on the assumptions made for socioeconomic,
                                techno-economic, and agronomic parameters. Given the role that GCAM-USA might play in
                                the PARIS REINFORCE project, some input parameters will be most relevant for the model

                                            matter smaller than 2.5 µm in diameter, and energy-related water demands
                                            are evaluated for 50% and 80% CO2 reduction targets in 2050. The renewable
                                            low-carbon pathways require less water withdrawal and consumption than the
                                            nuclear and carbon capture pathways. However, the renewable low-carbon
                                            pathways modelled in this study produce higher particulate matter-related
                                            mortality costs due to greater use of biomass in residential heating.

                                            The United States has developed a Mid-Century Strategy to reduce
                                            economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 80% or more below 2005
                                            levels by 2050. Achieving these reductions will entail a major
                                            transformation of the energy system, including the electric power sector.
                                            The scenarios in this study include substantial decarbonisation of the
                                            electric power sector, increased electrification of end-use sectors, and
                                            increase in the deployment of low- and zero-carbon technologies such as
                                            renewables, nuclear and carbon capture utilisation and storage. The
                                            results show that the degree to which the electric power sector will need
                                            to decarbonise depends on the nature of technological advances in the
                                            energy sector, and the degree to which end-use sectors electrify.

                                            Existing pipeline infrastructure in the U.S. is insufficient to satisfy
                                            the increasing demand for natural gas, and investments in pipeline
                                            capacity will be required. However, the geographic distribution of
                                            investments within the U.S. is heterogeneous and depends on the capacity
                                            of existing infrastructure as well as the magnitude of increase in demand.
                                            The results also illustrate the risks of under-utilisation of pipeline
                                            capacity, in particular, under a scenario characterised by long-term
                                            systemic transitions toward a low-carbon economy. More broadly, this study
                                            highlights the value of integrated approaches to facilitate informed
                                            decision-making.
