                                The North American TIMES Energy Model (NATEM) is an optimisation model
                                that belongs to the TIMES family of models—for a brief explanation of TIMES see
                                the MAPLE model description in Section 3.6.1. NATEM is currently the only
                                detailed optimisation model in North America. The 23-region model optimises the
                                entire integrated energy systems, as well as non-energy GHG emitting sectors, of
                                Canada, the United States and Mexico. By capturing the large diversity of energy
                                systems and policies across the three countries using a consistent modelling
                                approach, it provides a rational framework for supporting adequate decision-making
                                related to climate policies over the 2050 horizon. Model results have been used by
                                decision makers from public and private organisations to draft the Climate Action
                                Plan, identify research priorities for reducing mitigation costs, prepare energy
                                transition outlooks, assess the impacts of energy projects and evaluate circular
                                economy strategies.

                                NATEM offers a comprehensive representation of the energy system of each of the
                                North American jurisdictions (see the figure below). It also models inter-jurisdictional
                                and international flows of energy and material commodities. The model is driven
                                by a set of about 70 end-use demands for energy services in five sectors:
                                agriculture, commercial, industrial, residential and transportation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the energy supply side, NATEM captures all sectors including electricity
                                and heat generation in many details. Other supply sectors include fossil fuels
                                extraction, upgrading and transport, uranium extraction and transport,
                                petroleum refining, bioenergy production, natural gas liquefaction and exports,
                                hydrogen supply chain, etc. Primary energy resources include conventional
                                and unconventional fossil fuels reserves (oil, gas, and coal), renewables
                                potentials (hydro, geothermal, wind, solar, tidal and wave), uranium reserves
                                and biomass (various solid, liquid and gaseous sources). Carbon capture options
                                are available in the electricity and industrial sectors. Sequestration potentials
                                exist for enhanced oil recovery, in oil and gas fields (onshore and offshore) and
                                in deep saline aquifers.

                                In each sector, a repository includes a large number of new technologies that
                                are in competition to satisfy each end-use demand including existing technologies,
                                improved versions of existing technologies and new technologies.

                            <p>The time horizon over which NATEM simulates the evolution of the energy system is
                                divided into a user-chosen number of time-periods. The model is currently solved
                                for the 2011-2050 timeframe through ten time periods of variable lengths. Short
                                time periods (1 to 2 years) are defined at the beginning of the horizon, while
                                longer time periods (5 years) are considered afterward, as uncertainties related to
                                data are increasing over time. Current milestone years (for which results are
                                generated) are: 2011, 2013, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050.
                                All years in a given period are considered identical. For all quantities such as
                                installed technology levels, power plant capacities and energy and emissions flows,
                                any annual input quantity (e.g. coal used in a power plant per year) or output
                                quantity (e.g. electricity generated from the coal plant per year) related to a
                                given time period applies identically to each of the years in that period.</p>

                                In addition to the multi-year time periods described above, in NATEM there
                                are time divisions <b>within</b> a year, called “time slices”,
                                which may be deﬁned by the user, so as to capture different weather,
                                consumer behaviours, and energy demand conditions at different times of
                                the year. There are currently sixteen time slices representing four
                                seasons a year (spring, summer, fall and winter) and four intraday
                                periods (day, night, morning peak, evening peak). The MAPLE model
                                documentation (Section 3.6.2.4) provides further detail of the purpose
                                of time-slices in the TIMES framework.

                                The NATEM model requires inputs concerning the degree to which energy service
                                demands, as well as demand for other goods and services which result in GHG
                                emissions, will grow over the course of next decades in the different countries.
                                It does this by using various socioeconomic inputs, as described below. Data will
                                be revised and updated before running the model under the PARIS REINFORCE project.

                                Demands for energy services are currently projected through 2050 using a coherent
                                set of socioeconomic assumptions from the projections of the National Energy Board
                                (NEB, 2017) for Canada, from the Annual Energy Outlook (EIA, 2018) for the United
                                States, and various national sources for Mexico (CONAPO, 2012; SENER, 2014;
                                PRODESEN, 2018). Demands for energy services are projected using national sources
                                specific to the three countries and not a single source. Demands are ultimately
                                projected through 2050 from the 2011 base year using the following growth index:

                                future announced projects, degree-day projections, number of households,
                                commercial surface, industrial gross output, etc.</p>

                                significantly across the three countries, where the GDP is expected to double
                                by 2050 in Canada and the United States, while a more than three-fold increase
                                is projected for Mexico. Although the economic structure varies from a country
                                to another, the three economies rest on abundant energy resources, both fossil
                                and renewables.

                                The growth in the industrial, agricultural and commercial sectors in each region is
                                partially derived from the national’s overall GDP growth, with each sector’s share
                                of total GDP changing over time, and from the expected/planned production levels,
                                constructions, and development of certain activities. These shares are derived
                                from a historical analysis of how all countries’ sectoral shares of output have
                                changed as their overall output grew. Growth of residential households is derived
                                from population growth and assumptions on average household size in each region.
                                Growth in each of these sectors drives energy demand as described in the next

                                be calibrated are: the capacities/stocks and operating levels of all technologies,
                                the extracted, exported, imported, produced, and consumed quantities for all energy
                                carriers, and the representation of new policy- and target-related elements.

                                As for all the TIMES-based models, the NATEM predominantly works by specifying
                                either a GHG price (e.g. a carbon tax) or a GHG limit (e.g. an upper bound
                                constraint) in one or several regions, or alternatively for all regions
                                simultaneously. Additionally, the following further policies and measures can be
                                implemented: subsidies or taxes on specific technologies, renewable portfolio
                                standards, minimum renewable content in conventional fuels, phase-out programs and
                                moratoria on some energy type (e.g. nuclear or hydrocarbon), investment growth rate
                                projections, etc.

                                This allows NATEM to perform a number of energy and climate policy-relevant
                                investigations. Indeed, NATEM has been used to assess the implications of meeting
                                ambitious GHG mitigation goals on the energy system configuration and cost, under many
                                different economic and technical assumptions. Model results have been used by decision
                                makers at national, regional and city levels in North America to
