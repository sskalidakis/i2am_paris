                                  MUSE is a modelling environment for the assessment of how national or multi-regional
                                  energy systems might change over time. Its scope is the entire energy system, from
                                  production of primary resources such as oil or biomass, through conversion of these
                                  resources into forms of energy for final consumption, and finally the end-use
                                  consumption of that energy to meet economy-wide service demands.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  MUSE is an agent-based framework, in that it explicitly characterises the
                                  decision-making process of firms and consumers in the energy system, thereby
                                  capturing a variety of features of market imperfection. MUSE is also
                                  technology-rich, in that it characterises the cost and performance of each technology
                                  option, tracks technology stock, and provides details on investment, operating costs,
                                  energy consumption, and emissions with a detailed bottom-up perspective.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The agent-based modular structure of the sectors is brought together in a partial
                                  equilibrium on the energy system through a market clearing algorithm, which balances
                                  supply and demand of each energy commodity. The market clearing algorithm is also
                                  able to enforce a carbon budget, which escalates a carbon price until agents in all
                                  sectors respond and emissions constraints are met.
                              </p>
                              <p>MUSE-Global is an implementation of a global model in the MUSE framework,
                                  characterising 28-regions of the world, and running over a time horizon of 2010 to
                                  2100. It can be used to explore a variety of questions on how to mitigate climate
                                  change given realistic constraints and frictions on system change, and has been
                                  applied to show that slightly sub-optimal transition pathways may be more likely
                                  to succeed than optimal ones.

                                  divided into a user-chosen number of time periods. In MUSE-Global, to be used in
                                  PARIS REINFORCE, there is a starting period of 2010, with further years divided
                                  in ten-year periods up to 2100. All years in a given period are considered identical.

                                  divisions within a year, called “time slices”, which may be deﬁned by the user,
                                  so as to capture different resource supply, weather and energy demand conditions
                                  at different times of the year. This is the case for instance when the demand for an
                                  electricity ﬂuctuates across the year and a variety of technologies may be chosen
                                  for its production at given times of the year (such as wind power when wind
                                  resources are high, and solar photovoltaics when there is a high availability of
                                  solar radiation).

                                  is dealt with via the imposition of emissions limits on each time period.
                                  The model tracks the three main sources of greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide
                                  (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O).
                                  These gases are tracked for each technology, sector, region and for the world,
                                  in each time period.

                                  The growth in the industrial, agricultural and retail business sectors in each region
                                  is derived from the region’s overall GDP growth, with regression applied to
                                  determine historical relationships, and the best fit matches for each service
                                  demand category being applied to project growth forwards. With reference to the
                                  agricultural sector, the historical trend of service demands (crop and meat demands
                                  between 1970 and 2015) are regressed against the exogenously given macroeconomic
                                  drivers (GDP and population) (see the figure below, from Kerdan et al., 2019d).

                                  The economic, population and sectoral growths are used to determine specific drivers
                                  for the growth in energy demands in a “reference” scenario in which there is no
                                  climate change mitigation. For example, in the agricultural sector, demand for one
                                  of the services is linked to demand for food. Being highly correlated with income
                                  and population growth, the regression model used in MUSE is represented in the
                                  following equation, because of the best fit with historical demand of food:
                              </p>
                              <p>

                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  where C represents the consumption of food per capita and GDPpc is the region GDP
                                  divided over the population.

                                  MUSE does not include endogenous own-price elasticity. Instead, demand changes may
                                  be modelled via sensitivity analysis.

                                  As described above, MUSE uses an agent-based formulation to determine possible
                                  pathways of energy system transition. As such, socioeconomic categorisation of
                                  populations of investors and/or consumers is used to capture heterogeneity in
                                  investment decision making. The technique relies upon survey data, and widely
                                  available socioeconomic metrics, e.g. from the World Bank to achieve this. For
                                  example, in the building sector the SINUS-Milieus Typology (Sinus Sociovision, 2017)
                                  was used for the classification and attributes assignment of agents. According to the
                                  methodology introduced above, socioeconomic survey data of household representative
                                  persons can be adopted to allocate households into social groups.

                                  capacity and emissions further calibrated to 2015. The main variables to be
                                  calibrated are the capacities and operating levels of all technologies present in
                                  the world in 2010; the extracted, exported, imported, produced, and consumed

                                  MUSE is a technology-rich model that represents most major fossil fuel and low-carbon
                                  technologies that are envisaged to be available for at least the first half of the
                                  21st century. As described above, the calibration process determines what technologies

                                  MUSE simulates a microeconomic equilibrium on the energy system. It consists of
                                  modular independent agent-based sector modules, joined together by a market clearing
                                  algorithm.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The market clearing algorithm iterates across all of the sector modules,
                                  interchanging price and quantity of each energy commodity in each region, until an
                                  equilibrium is reached. It sends commodity prices to the end-use sectors and receives
                                  back demand for each of these commodities. It sums up these demands and sends them
                                  to the conversion and/or supply sectors, which in turn send back a price. This is
                                  used to inform an updated price in the market clearing algorithm, whence the
                                  procedure iterates again (i.e. updated prices are sent to the end-use sectors, etc).
                                  Eventually this process results in a microeconomic equilibrium for each energy
                                  commodity in each region. When investigating climate change mitigation, a carbon
                                  budget is imposed on each time period. A GHG emissions price is then set in the
                                  market clearing algorithm such that the carbon budget is achieved (i.e. by pricing
                                  emissions, and thereby incentivising investment in low emissions technology in all
                                  sectors via the agent-based modelling described below).

                                  Each agent-based sector module in MUSE is modelled in a way that is appropriate for
                                  that sector (i.e. MUSE is a hybrid modular approach). As such, MUSE developers are
                                  able to characterise investment decision making in different ways in each sector,
                                  to capture the features that are the most important and therefore produce a more
                                  realistic representation of energy system transitions. MUSE uses socioeconomic and
                                  firm-level data and analyses to characterise a set of investment decision makers
                                  (agents) for each sector. Each sector then applies an agent-based modelling (ABM)
                                  approach where “agents” (firms or consumers) apply rules to (a) determine which
                                  technologies will be considered for investment; (b) calculate a set of objectives
                                  according to their decision making preferences; and (c) use a method to combine
                                  these objectives to make a final investment decision. Each of these steps is bespoke,
                                  where developers can choose from a set of pre-defined rules or can code and add their
                                  own objectives and decision rules.

                                  As such, overall MUSE is a limited-foresight model that strives to represent the
                                  frictions and challenges that could occur as the world aims for systemic technology
                                  change to achieve climate change mitigation over the coming eight decades. Data
                                  paucity, technology cost and performance uncertainty, and spatial and temporal
                                  coarseness are all weaknesses of this approach, as they are with any other form of
                                  integrated assessment modelling.

                                  The MUSE model requires inputs concerning the degree to which energy demand, as well
                                  as demand for other goods and services which result in GHG emissions (such as
                                  agricultural demand), will change over the time horizon. Future demand projections of
                                  each service in each region are based on societal input variables, i.e. population
                                  and GDP.

                              MUSE is usually applied by specifying either a carbon tax or a carbon emissions constraint
                              for the world as a whole. This acts as a proxy for all other climate-related policies.
                              However, a further range of policy levers are possible to implement in MUSE, as follows:

                              <p>MUSE does not calculate non-climate SDGs. However, it is possible to take MUSE’s
                                  outputs and perform “off-model” calculations to estimate many of the SDG implications.
                                  For example, MUSE reports the quantity of offshore wind power plants in each of its
                                  reporting years. This allows an estimation of the employment that such activity would
                                  generate in the region. Furthermore, MUSE may be coupled with macroeconomic and/or
                                  lifecycle assessment tools in order to calculate SDG-relevant quantities; for example,
                                  impact on income distribution, impact on air or water quality, etc.</p>
